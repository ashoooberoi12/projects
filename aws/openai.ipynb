Minimum Standards and \\nControls are not to be used as a substi tute for good scientific procedures. On an \\nindividual case, the minimum indicated may not suffice to complete identification as \\ndefined. It is the primary res ponsibility of the chemist to id entify the controlled substance \\nrather than simply fulfill these standards.  The analysis of controlled substances depends  on the type of sample material submitted \\nfor analysis. This can be a powder, liquid, licit or illicit tablets or capsules, plant material \\nor residue. The choice of methods  used for the analysis of th is wide variety of different \\nmaterials will vary with each ca se. Because of this, a specific  procedure devoted to each \\ndrug is neither reasonable nor possible. Rather , the methods used in an analysis will be \\nspecified in a general manner for use by the ex aminer in the analysis of a particular \\nsample.  Sample preparation consists of both mass determination and sampling techniques. Consideration should be given to each before  conducting analytical tests. See Appendix \\nII, Appendix III, Appendix IV (sections A-E), and Appendix V for policies regarding both of these areas.  After the mass is determined, the analyst must decide which method will be chosen to perform a preliminary or scr eening test. This includes: \\n \\n1. Physical identification by a referenc e source for legitimate preparations \\n2. Color Test \\n3. Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) \\n4. Gas Chromatography (GC)  \\nLess commonly, screening can be done  by Infrared Spectroscopy or Gas \\nChromatography/ Mass Spectrometry or other acceptable analytical tests. \\n After the preliminary test is performed, a s econd test, such as Infrared Spectroscopy (IR) \\nand/or Mass Spectrometry (MS)  which gives structural information sufficient for the \\npositive identification of the co mpound, will be utilized. The use of one preliminary and \\none structural test for the identification of a controlled substance is a minimum. If more \\ntests are required to positively identify the material, an examiner is required to perform them to reach a conclusion as to whether a controlled substance is present or not. \\n For identification criteria and other guidelines  for drug analysis see Appendix IV sections \\nA through E. \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

These \\npreparations must be from a commercial manufacturer. Tablets and capsules of clandestine manufacture or counterfeit cannot be identified with this procedure. A positive identification \\nobtained by comparing to a listed or similar reference can be us ed as a preliminary test on a \\nstandard commercia l dosage unit. \\n \\nSAFETY CONSIDERATIONS \\nStandard Laboratory Practices.  \\nPREPARATIONS \\nNone Required.  \\nINSTRUMENTATION \\nGenerally none required, however, a stereoscope may be useful in identifying numbers or \\nsymbols inscribed on the products.  \\nMINIMUM STANDARDS AND CONTROLS \\nThe reference used and the result will be docum ented in the  analytical notes packet. The \\nreference should include the year  of the reference (e.g. PDR) or  the number/volume  and page \\nnumber (e.g. Identidex).  For we bpages, a copy of the source (e .g. PDF) must be uploaded \\ninto LIMS. The date the webpage  was accessed, URL, etc. must  also be docum ented in the \\nanalytical notes packet.  When Physical Identification is used as a refe rence to determine the potential contents of a \\ntablet, it is permissible to use the conclusion “Not Analyzed” provided no further analysis is \\nperformed. A conclusion of “Physically resembles a pharmaceutical preparation; no further analysis” is also allowed, but not required. For instan ces where the tablets can be seen through \\nthe evidence packaging, Physical Identification can be used as a reference in the analyst’s \\nnotes without being included on the report.   \\nPROCEDURE OR ANALYSIS \\nI. VISUAL EXAMINATION \\n \\nThe chemist should make a thorough visual ex amination of the mate rial submitted for \\nanalysis. This may include the use of the st ereoscope. Notes should include a description \\nof the following characteristics, if applicable \\n \\nColor: A descriptio n of the color. \\n Shape: A description which may include a drawing. \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.   Accepted Date:      September 13, 2024 \\nDrug Chemistry Procedures Manual DC-A-1 \\nPage 3 of 4 \\nVersion 2024.09.13 Procedure:    Physical Identification \\n  \\nMarkings:  A description which may includ e a drawing of the markings found on the \\ntablet or capsule. \\n Other:  Additional observations may include: condition of the material, edge shape \\nand size of the tablet or capsule, an d any other releva nt observations. \\n \\nII. LITERATURE COMPARISONS   \\n \\nThe use of identification guides is suggested in the case of pharmaceutical preparations. \\nThe unknown is compared to a known pha rmaceutical or a representation \\ndescription/picture of a known pharmaceutical. Th e information gained can be considered \\nin much the same way as the information gained by any examination of external characteristics. The results provide pr eliminary or presum ptive information. \\n When doing a physical identification on a dosag e form, care must be taken to ascertain \\nthat the drug has not been tampered with a nd that it is of leg itimate, as opposed to \\nclandestine, origin. The markings, shape, size, color, etc. must be the same as shown/described in the reference.  Optical activity may be determined from a le gitimate reference source or identification \\nguide (e.g. PDR). If the reference/guide notates optical rotation, then no further testing for \\noptical rotation need be performed. Propoxyphe ne is an example of this type of \\nidentification. However, the report must sp ecify dextropropoxyphene as required from the \\nControlled Substance Act. \\n \\n1. The Physicians’ Desk Reference (PDR) \\n2. Identidex \\n3.

They are not a pos itive identification test. They are, however, a good \\nscreening or presumptive test because they indicate  the type of compound present and give clues as \\nto its structure. \\n There is always a certain amount of  subjectivity that must be taken into account when a color is \\nreported. It is not uncommon for two chemists to de scribe the same color differently. Aside from the \\ndifferences in reporting colors that can be attributed to the analyst, colors can also be influenced by \\nthe concentration of the solvent or solute or by th e presence of diluents or contaminants. Also, the \\nlength of time during which the colors are observed may influence the color reported because color transitions and instabilities ar e not unusual. Allowances should be made for th ese differences, \\nespecially with street samples, where neither th e concentration of the dr ug nor the presence or \\ncomposition of an\\ny diluent or contaminant is known. \\n SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS \\n Precaution should be taken when preparing or handli ng color test reagents. Several reagents contain \\nstrong acids which can penetr ate clothing or lab coats and cause inju ries if they come  in contact with \\nskin.  These reagents can also splatter, effervesce, or emit noxious or harm ful vapors. For these \\nreasons, the reagents should be prepared and th e tests should be conducted in the hood while wearing \\nproper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). \\n \\nPREPARATIONS \\n Some common reagent formulations are given on th e following pages. The out line also includes \\ninformation for the type of drug that  reacts with each sp ecific reagent.  The intended uses are not an \\nexhaustive list. Where po ssible, American Chemical Society (ACS) grade of chemicals should be \\nemployed when preparing in-house reagents. The amounts of reagent used in testing the samples are \\nsuggested guidelines and can vary. \\n \\n CHEN’S TEST \\n  Intended Use: \\nFormulation: Non-controlled stimulants and ephedrine \\nA. B.

It can be  used as a general screening \\ntest and the relative re tention factor (Rf) and visualized colors can be co mpared to a known \\nstandard that is run with the sample to verify the results. \\n \\nSAFETY CONSIDERATIONS \\nStandard Laboratory Practices. Bo th mobile phases and visualizer s should be prepared in the \\nhood. Also, any spraying of visualizers should  be performed in the hood with the spray \\ndirected into a spray box or similar container. \\n PREPARATIONS \\nUnless otherwise noted, all chemicals should be  of the highest grade attainable (ACS or \\nreagent grade preferably) to avoid contam ination problems and to ensure reactivity. \\nVISUALIZERS \\nVanillin  1 gram vanillin in 20 mL sulfuric acid \\nKIPT   0.25 g Platinic Chloride \\n5 g Potassium Iodide \\n    Dilute to 100 mL with water Acidified KIPT 5 mL concentrated Hydrochloric Acid is added to 100 mL KIPT Ehrlich’s  Ehrlich’s color reagent diluted 1:1 with Ethanol (95%) Fiorese’s  Reagent A:  10 % Ferric Chloride in water \\nReagent B:  15% Potass ium Iodide in water  \\n        1 mL concentrated Hydrochloric Acid \\nReagent C:  Water (optional) \\nN,2,6   Reagent A: 1% Sodi um Hydroxide in Methanol \\nReagent B: 0.5% of N,2,6-Tr ichloro-p-benzoquinoneimine \\n(TCBI) in Chloroform \\nFast Blue B salt 0.2 g in 10 mL of water Fast Blue BB salt 0.2 g in 10 mL of water \\n \\nMINIMUM STANDARDS AND CONTROLS \\nThe following are requirements to  meet the minimum standards and controls for Thin-Layer \\nChromatography: \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

The solvent system and method of visualiz ation will be documented on the worksheet \\n(abbreviations are acceptable). \\n \\n2. TLC chambers will be labeled with the solv ent system, preparer’s initials, and date \\nprepared.  \\n \\n3. Reference standards (primary or secondary) will be run on the plate. The results will be indicated on the worksheet. The lot numbe r or laboratory inventory number of the \\nstandard(s) must be docu mented in the case file. \\n \\n4. All TLC visualizing reagents will be tested when prepared and as indicated in QM-14, using a primary or secondary standard. Labe lling, including a hazard label, and record \\nretention will be followed per QM-14. \\n \\n5. Reviewable data such as a phot o (color, if possible, otherwis e accurately labeled) of the \\ndeveloped TLC plate shall be included in the case file. \\n \\n6. Spot color developmen t (if any) and relative retentio n factor calculations must be \\ndocumented in the case file.   \\n \\nII. Comparisons \\n \\n1. After the plate is deemed suitable for comparison (as delineated in DC-App II), a \\ndirect comparison shall be made between  the sample and the included reference \\nstandard(s).   \\n \\n2. The relative retention factor shall be calcula ted for spots of target  analytes that will \\nbe subject to a comparison.  Measurements shall be taken (in centimeters) from the \\norigin to the center of the spot.  For instances where multiple samples of the same case/item number are run on the same plate and are referenced to a single standard, it is acceptable to document the relative retention factor of each extreme sample spot (i.e. the low and the high) inst ead of every individual spot.   \\n \\n3. A positive result or indication occurs when th e relative retention ratio is between 0.85 \\nand 1.15. If a chemical visualizer is used and a color is present, the spot(s) must exhibit \\na similar color reaction as the reference standard(s).  \\n FORMULA FOR A RELATIVE R ETENTION FACTOR CALCULATION \\n \\nRf of sample versus Rf of Referenc e Standard Run on the Same Plate (=R st) \\n  R\\nst  = Analyte distance sample  \\n   Analyte distance standard \\n \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

Commercially \\nprepared TLC plates (or HPTLC plates) with or without a fluor escent indicator will be used. \\nThe developing solvent is allowed to equilibra te in a sealed TLC chamber. (Note:  For \\nHPTLC, a smaller glass chamber is used since only 5 to 10 mL of solvent is needed.) \\n \\nThe reference standard(s) and unknown sample(s ) are dissolved in a suitable, non-aqueous \\nsolvent and spotted on the origin above the so lvent line. The plate is  placed in the chamber \\nand developed to the desired hei ght. The plate is then air dried, visualized by ultraviolet (UV) \\nlight and/or sprayed with a selected visualizi ng agent. A positive test results if the relative \\nretention ratio is within the acceptable range and,  if visualized with a chemical visualizing \\nagent, their colors are similar. These and other factors are noted. \\n EXAMPLES OF SOLVENT SYSTEMS \\n \\nTYPE OF DRUG DEVELOPING SYSTEM (Vol: Vol Ratio) \\nCannabis Cannabis, Salvinorin A General Screen Hexane: Ether (4:1) Hexane: Acetone (4:1) Methanol: Ammonia (95:5) \\nGeneral Screen CDEN (Chloroform, Dioxane, Ethyl Acetate, Ammonia) \\n(25:60:10:5) \\nGeneral Screen LSD Acetonitrile: Ammonia (95:5) Acetone: Ammonia saturated chloroform (2:1) \\nLSD Cyclohexane: Acetone: Di ethyl Ether: Diethylamine \\n(35:30:30:5) \\nPsiloc\\nyn/Psiloc ybin n-Butanol: Acetic Acid: Water (2:1:1) \\nPsiloc yn/Psiloc ybin Methanol: Ammonia (95:5) \\nSalvinorin A Hexane: Eth yl Acetate (1:1) \\nSteroids Chloroform: Eth yl Acetate (4:1) \\n EXAMPLES OF VISUALIZERS \\n \\nTYPE OF DRUG  VISUALIZER \\nGeneral Screening KIPT \\nFiorese’s \\nCannabis Fast Blue B \\nFast Blue BB N,2,6-Trichloro-p-\\nbenzoquiononeimine (TCBI) \\nLSD diluted Ehrlich’s Psiloc\\nyn/Psiloc ybin diluted Ehrlich’s \\nSalvinorin A Vanilli n \\nSteroids Ethanol: Sulfuric Acid (4:1) \\n \\n \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

FTIR data may be acquired by multip le methods. Two of the methods employed by \\nISP include transmission and inte rnal reflection. Both methods often require purification of the \\nsample prior to analysis. \\nTransmission spectra are produced  by measuring the energy transmitted through a sample when a \\nsingle-path infrared beam passes through it. Sample prep aration may require ch emical extraction \\nin addition to pe llet preparation. \\nFor FTIR using internal reflecti on, a multiple-path infrared beam is passed through an internal \\nreflecting element (IRE) w ith a high refractive inde x at a certain angle. The most common IRE is \\na diamond, and acquisition is usually  via an attenuated total reflec tion (ATR) instrument accessory. \\nThe internal reflection creates an  evanescent wave which extends above the crystal IRE. When a \\nsample is held in contact with the IRE, the sa mple absorbs energy and th e evanescent wave is \\naltered or attenuated. This attenua ted energy is passed back into the infrared beam. A detector \\nmeasures the changes in the beam and produces an infrared spectrum. \\nIdentifications made using FTIR rely on comparisons of peak positions and relative peak \\nintensities between sample and standard spectra.  This is true whethe r data is acquired via \\ntransmission or internal reflec tion methods. While transmission and internal reflection spectra of \\nthe same substance will show distinct similariti es and may provide useful  information as to the \\nidentification of a specific substa nce, care must be taken to ensure  that identifications are made \\nbased on comparisons of spectra acquired in the same manner (i.e. transmission or internal \\nreflection). \\n \\nRELATED PROCEDURES \\n \\nExtractions (Appendix III) \\n \\nSAFETY CONSIDERATIONS \\n \\nFTIRs use a laser beam to align the mirrors duri ng the operation of the instrument. Do not look \\ndirectly into the beam as da mage to the eyes can result. \\n \\nPREPARATIONS \\n \\nIn some instances, such as when an ATR accessory is used, there is no sample preparation required. \\nThe sample may be used directly  (run neat) or extracte d. However, when a pellet is required for \\ntransmission spectral acquisition, th e sample must be pressed into an IR-transparent pellet, using \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

Documentation \\n \\n1. A copy of the IR spectrum will  be included in th e case file. At leas t two peaks will be \\npeak-picked and labeled with the wavenumber of the apex. These peaks should be \\nwithin the 2000-1300 cm-1 region, whenever possible. Th e peaks selected for labeling \\nshall correlate directly to th e peaks used for comparison to  a reference standard, which \\nwill be noted in the case fi le. In addition, if using an ATR accessory, a blank will be \\nrun and included in the case file. An ATR accessory requires a blank to be run before \\nevery sample. \\n \\n2. The IR collection parameters (number of scan s, resolution) as well as the case number, \\nitem number, analyst’s initials, and date will  be recorded on spectra. Item number is \\noptional on standards. The optic al isomer (where applicable ) and the salt form of the \\nstandard used for compar ison will be recorded. \\n \\n3. The worksheet will indicate the result of th e IR and any additional spectra will be \\nreferenced to the worksheet (excluding standa rds). Spectra shall be traceable to the IR \\nfrom which they were generated. Data that  is NOT suitable for comparison, but is \\nincluded in the case file, mu st be distinguishable from da ta that is suitable for \\ncomparison. This can be accomp lished by associating sample s with their corresponding \\nspectra and results in the “Notes” panel in LIMS or through annotat ions on the included \\nspectra. \\n \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

If an acquisition method other than the ATR acce ssory is used, it shall be indicated in \\nthe work notes. \\nII. Screening Parameters \\n1. The following is an example of  recommended method parameters: \\nNumber of scans: 32 to 36* \\n*internal reflectance scans s hould be a square number  \\nResolution: 4 cm-1 \\nGain: 1 \\nApodization: Triangular  \\nStarting wavenumber: 4000 cm-1 \\n Ending wavenumber: 500 cm-1 \\n \\nIII. Comparisons \\n \\n1. Any qualitative comparison(s) wi ll be made to in-house stan dards after the data  has \\nbeen assessed for suitability (see DC-App II). \\n2. To make an identificat ion, the spectrum must be  compared to an in -house, peak- picked \\nprimary standard run on the same instrument  and under the same conditions.  For FTIR, \\nthis includes number of scans, scan range, resolution, and acquisition method (pellet or \\nATR). \\n3. A positive identification may be made when: \\ni. Sample and standard spectra exhibit general pattern correspondence of peaks \\nand relative intensities, and \\nii. At least two peaks are compared be tween the sample and the reference \\nstandard and are within +/- 1 cm-1 of each other. These peaks should be within \\nthe 2000-1300 cm-1 region whenever possible. When two peaks are not \\npresent in this region, then the most  abundant peaks will be compared. \\nCorresponding peak wavenumbers will be labeled on both the sample and the \\nreference standard spectra. [NOTE: transmission and internal reflectance methods should produce similar spectra, but corresponding wavenumbers \\nmay differ by more than +/- 1 cm\\n-1. If a reference standard  is available that \\nwas acquired by a different mode than th e sample spectrum, the data may still \\nbe used to support a conclusion, given the presen ce of relevant data from a \\nseparate confirmatory testing technique.] \\n4. The reference standard used for comparison (including the lot numb er or laboratory \\ninventory number) must be included in the case file, and the wavenumbers of the two \\npeaks used for the comp arison will be documented. \\n5. In the event that a primary, in -house spectrum is not availabl e, an identification may be \\nmade using two peer reviewed reference s ources, ie. IDDA or Pfleger, provided the \\nfollowing is true: \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

Both sources are of indepe ndent and known origin, AND \\nii. Sample and both reference spectra exhibit overall pattern similarities, AND \\niii. On the sample and at least one of the standard reference spectra, exact \\nwavenumbers of at least 2 peaks are identified, within the 2000-1300 cm-1 \\nwhenever possible, and are within +/- 1 cm-1 of each other, AND \\niv. Reference standards were obtained by th e same acquisition  method as the \\nsample (e.g. samples analyzed via ATR must be compared to standards run \\nvia ATR), AND \\nv. Images of the sources used for compar ison shall be included in the case file. \\n \\nIV. Function Checks/Positive Controls \\n \\n1. A polystyrene standard or an internal f unction check mechanism (e.g. Valpro) will be \\nrun at least once a month on bot h the FTIR and ATR (when present), or more frequently \\nif indicated by instrument perfo rmance. If the instrument is not used on a routine basis, \\nthe polystyrene standard or in ternal function check may be  completed before use. The \\nreports of the internal func tion check mechanism must pass all aspects of the reported \\ntests as defined by the manufac turer and will be compared to previous run reports. A \\nsource voltage value, the IR peak to peak (P2P) value, and the P2P value for the ATR \\nwill be recorded and maintain ed in the instrument logbook (or online equivalent). For \\na single bounce diamond ATR accessory, the P2 P with the ATR installed should be at \\nleast 10% of the FTIR P2P. If   it is not,  an alignment may need to be performed. \\n2. A positive control shall be run following any function checks. The same traceable \\nreference material will be run monthly or as needed under the same instrumental \\nconditions. A traceable polystyrene reference or drug standard will be used as the \\npositive control. These control spectra will be peak-picked and compared to previous peak-picked spectra, and maintained in the instrument logbook (or online equivalent). \\nDeviations of greater than +/- 1 cm\\n-1 of prominent peaks in  the 2000-1300 cm-1 region \\nfrom the prior function check w ill need to be considered. \\n \\nPROCEDURE OR ANALYSIS \\n \\nI. FTIR using internal reflectance (ATR accessory) \\n \\n1. Background Spectrum \\ni. The ATR attachment should be cleaned, and a new background collected prior to use.  The background is to be acq uired with the arm in the up position. \\nii. It is advisable to  collect a b ackground spectrum every 5-10 minutes to \\nminimize the impact of environmental factors on analytical spectra.  \\n2. Blank Spectrum \\ni. Prior to each sample, a blank spectrum  should be run with the arm down. It \\nwill be included in the working file  and will be noted on the worksheet.  \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

The analyst will ensure that the ATR atta chment is clean.  If the blank has any \\nunusual peaks, the ATR attachment must  be re-cleaned and the blank run \\nagain. \\n3. Sample Spectrum \\ni. A sample is placed on the diamond mount area. The clamp containing the \\nappropriate anvil is secured only to the point that good  contact is maintained \\nbetween the sample and the diamond.  \\nii. When working with a liquid, it shou ld be dropped onto the diamond mount \\nand allowed to evaporate completely so th at crystals may form directly on the \\ndiamond before clamping the anvil.  \\niii. The resulting  spectra are compared to standards obtained in the same manner. \\n \\nII. FTIR using transmission (pellet) \\n \\n1. A small amount of the sample is mixed with KBr using a mortar and pestle. After  the two have been sufficiently mixed, the mixtu re is placed in the pellet die and a KBr \\npellet is made. (The size of the pellet is optional). If ne cessary, a background spectrum \\nof KBr should be taken and stored in the co mputer. The sample pellet is  placed on the \\nIR and a spectrum of th e substance is obtained. \\n \\nREPORT WORDING \\n \\nSee Appendix I – Report Wording \\n \\nREFERENCES \\n \\n1.

GC-\\nMS can be used for screening purposes, howev er, its most common us e is for structural \\ninformation from the mass spect rometer for the positive identification of a compound. The \\ninstrument can be used with an automated sampler and for quantitation. \\n The qualitative analysis of unknown substa nces by GC-MS is accomplished by direct \\ncomparison with a standard sp ectrum for an identification. The mass spectrum must be \\ninterpreted. This does not mean that all the fragments must be assigned but rather the chemist must determine if the unknown and the standard are th e same substance. This is \\ndone by comparing the mass of each fragment and its relative intensity in the unknown to the standard. Retention time comparisons from GC-MS can also be used as preliminary \\ntesting.  When retention time da ta is used in conjunction wi th mass spectral data, a GC-MS \\nrun is still considered a single test for the purposes of meeting the minimum requirement of two tests.  The computer is used to acquire data in a form  which can be used by the chemist.  It should \\nnot alter the fundamental data.  \\nSAFETY CONSIDERATIONS \\nStandard Laboratory Practices. \\n PREPARATIONS \\nThe sample will usually be dissolved in a suita ble solvent prior to introduction into the GC-\\nMS. Examples include but are not limited to: \\nMethanol Chloroform \\n INSTRUMENTATION \\nGas Chromatograph with Mass Selective De tector with or without autosampler \\n Reference: Operator’s Manual \\n MINIMUM STANDARDS AND CONTROLS \\nThe following are requirements to meet minimum standards and controls for gas chromatography - ma ss spectrometry: \\n    \\n \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

Documentation \\n 1. A copy of the spectrum and the entire total ion chromatogram will  be included in the \\ncase file. a. If there are no peaks indicating the possible presence of an analyte in an unknown sample, i.e. the unknown sample TIC appears similar to a blank, a spectrum does not need to be included. \\n \\n2. The identification of a compound must be based on visual comparison of the \\nfragmentation pattern to that  of a reference standard. \\n \\na. Subtractions of backgro und noise should not change the fundamental data, and \\ntherefore need not be recorded on the worksheet.  \\nb. Subtractions of a separate compound require  the original, subtracted and resultant \\nspectra to be documented in the case file. \\ni. If multiple units have a similar original spec trum requiring a similar \\nsubtracted spectrum for each sample, one original and one subtracted spectrum from a single sample can  be used for documentation.   \\n1. Spectra not included will be docu mented in the case file.  For \\nexample, “Original and subtracted  spectra included  for 1.1, similar \\nsubtractions completed for 1.2-1.10, spectra not included”. \\n2. Resultant spectra for each unit will be included. \\n \\n3. The instrumental conditions, including carrier gas, colu mn, injection temperature, \\ninjection volume, split ratio, oven temperature, oven ramps, oven hold times, solvent \\ndelay, auxiliary or mass selective detector  (MSD) interface temperature, scan range, \\nand tune file or tune type (e.g. atune, stune, etc.) will be re corded in the case file. Any \\nadditional modifications to the method (e.g. turning the detect or off/on, pres sure ramps, \\netc.), not included on the footer, must be noted in the case file. \\n \\n4. The case number, analyst’s initials, item number, and date will be recorded on all  copies. Item number is optional on standards.  (Per the blank policy in Appendix IV-A, \\nitem number is also optional on blank chromatograms/spectra.) \\n \\n \\n5. The worksheet will indicate mass spectrometer results and all spectra must be referenced to the worksheet (excluding standa rds). The spectra will be traceable to the \\nGC-MS from which they were generated. Data that is NOT suitable for comparison must be distinguishable from data that is suitable for compar ison. This can be \\naccomplished by associating samples with th eir corresponding spectra and results in \\nthe “Notes” panel in LIMS or throu gh annotations on the included spectra. \\n \\nII.

When appropriate, it is acceptable to us e a weak method for an initial screening \\n(e.g. residue or small sample amount), how ever, this should not be routine and \\nwill be documented on the worksheet. \\nc. Methods tailored for the id entification of a particular  drug (or class of drugs) \\nare exempt from th ese requirements. \\n \\nIII. Comparisons \\n 1. The mass spectrum  shall be compared to an in-house standard, either primary or \\nsecondary, after the data has been as sessed for suitability (see DC-App II). \\na. The standard must be run on the same instrument and under the same mass \\nspectral conditions.  This includes auxiliary or MSD interface temperature, scan range, and tune file or tune  type. (Solvent delay is no t required as it relates to \\nturning the detector off/on.) \\nb. The standard for comparison (including th e lot number or laboratory inventory \\nnumber) must be included in the case file.  \\nc. For a qualitative mass spectral comparison, the age of the spectrum of the in-house reference standard is not crucial if the analytical conditions meet the \\ncriteria in item (a) above, and the in strument has met th e requirements of \\nfunction checks and positive controls.   \\nd. An identification shall onl y result when a prepondera nce of ions across the \\nspectrum exhibit general correspondence of abundan ces between ions of \\ncorresponding nominal m/z values. \\na. The sample and the reference standard  shall exhibit the same base peak, \\nunless variations have been documented by the laboratory. \\nb. The sample and reference standard sh all exhibit the same molecular ion, \\nwhen observed, unless variations have been documented by the laboratory. \\nc. Isotopic ion distributions observed in  the reference spectrum shall be \\npresent in the sample spectrum. \\ne. In the case that a standard is unavailable , an identification  may be made using \\ntwo appropriate literature sources or ex ternal standard references, provided the \\nsources are evaluated according to parameters outlined in DC-App IV-A.  Care must be taken to verify that mass spectr al data coupled to other available testing \\nis sufficient to conclusively identify th e substance in questi on.  Additionally, \\nthe following conditions must be met: a. The sources used for comparison must be of independent origin, and these \\nshall be documented in the case file, \\nb. Both spectra shall be of sufficient  abundance to allow for meaningful \\ncomparisons, \\nc. Both shall exhibit th\\ne same base p eak and molecular ion, when one is \\nobserved, \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

Both shall exhibit general corresp ondence in relative abundance of a \\nmajority of ions across the spectra, and \\ne. Both shall be included in the case file. \\n \\n2. If GC-MS data is used to compare retenti on times, this comparis on will be clearly \\ndocumented.  It is not require d to utilize this informatio n unless it is necessary to \\nsupport a specific conclusion.  (E xamples of useful retenti on time comparisons include, \\nbut are not limited to, isomer differentia tion such as between pseudoephedrine and \\nephedrine, or the positional isomers of methylethcathinone.)   \\na. If no retention time comparison is noted, it  will be understood that the retention \\ntime data from the coupled t echnique was not considered. \\nb. For retention time comparisons, the standa rd for comparison must be run on the \\nsame instrument under the same conditions. This includes the column, carrier \\ngas, oven temperatures, oven ramps, oven hold times, auxiliary or MSD \\ninterface temperature, scan range, and tune file or tune type, as well as any other \\nmethod modifications affec ting retention time.  (In jection parameters and \\nsolvent delay are excluded as  they relate to sample introduction into the system, \\nnot separation.) \\nc.

The following  ranges are used to \\nqualify the function check: \\n \\no Mass assignments of 69, 219, 502 are +/-0.2 amu. \\no Isotopic ratio of 70 to 69 falls in the 0.5 – 1.6% range \\no Isotopic ratio of 220 to 219 falls in the 3.2 – 5.4% range \\no Isotopic ratio of 503 to 502 falls in the 6.5-13.5% range  \\n \\n2. A logbook (or online equivalent) will be kept for the instrument to record maintenance, function checks, positive controls, and standards for comparison. \\na. An autotune will be performed monthly or more frequently if indicated by instrument performance or usage, or be fore operation if no t used on a routine \\nbasis. A record of the tune will be retained. \\nb. A positive control will be run after every autotune.  For the purposes of mass spectrometry, the positive c ontrol is one or more re ference materials run under \\nthe same conditions, on the same method on a routine basis.  Before accepting a positive control, it must be compared to a previously accepted control or refe\\nrence material.  \\nc.

In addition, the weight or numb er of tablets may need to be \\nextrapolated.  This section will outline H ypergeometric Sampling, Bayesian Sampling, and \\nthe Determination of Weight or Number of Units.  The calculated numb er of units must be \\nindividually tested as to meet the Minimum Standards and Controls for analysis. \\n \\nSAFETY CONSIDERATIONS \\nNo additional safety considerations.   \\n PREPARATIONS \\nNo additional preparations are necessary.  \\n INSTRUMENTATION \\nENFSI Sampling Software (Second Edition, dated July 2017)  \\n  DEFINITIONS \\nBias: Havin\\ng a preference or tendenc y to favor. \\nConsistent: The same in ph ysical appearance, markin gs, color, size. \\nDosage: Distinct segregated item s that are intended for individual \\nconsumption. \\nHomogenous: Uniform in physical appearance  (size, color, consistency, markings, \\netc.) \\nNegative: Havin g composition that stra ys in comparison to other items tested. \\nPositive: Having composition that yields consistent results with all other \\nitems tested, whether the substance contained is controlled or not. \\nRandom Sample: Selection of items to be tested without bias.  \\nRepresentative Sample: A small sample portion that is characteristic of the whole population \\nand is sufficient for testin g. \\nSampling: Selecting a representative  portion of a population to make a \\ndetermination a bout the whole. \\nTest Portion: The number of units determin ed from the sampling plan that is set \\naside for anal ysis. \\nUnit: A sin gle individual ob ject/member of a population \\n  MINIMUM STANDARDS AND CONTROLS \\n1.

The worksheet will reflect the sampling plan  used and a copy of the results of the \\ncalculations will be included in the case file. \\n \\n3. Typically, with Hypergeometric Sampling, 90 % of a population will be called at a 95% \\nconfidence level. Utilizing Bayesian Sampling, the entire population will be called at a 95% confidence level. Adjusti ng the percentage of the population analyzed is at the \\ndiscretion of the analyst in order to reach the highest attainable sentencing class. \\n \\n4. The units to be tested shall be randomly  selected from the to tal population. A random \\nnumber generator may be used. \\n \\n5. Each unit in the test portion will be anal yzed individually according to the testing \\nrequirements for that particular  type of evidence (e.g., powde rs, tablets, plant material, \\netc.). \\n \\n6. If a negative result is obtained, the samplin g plan will be aborted and testing the \\nappropriate number of units necessary for the charge will be completed. \\n REPORT WORDING \\nClarification will be made in the description for extrapolated/estimated weights and/or number of units. (See H1-C)  The analyst will add a remarks line on the re port to indicate the sampling plan used. \\n  REFERENCES \\n1. European Network of Forensic Science Inst itutes, Drugs Working Group.

In \\nthese cases, it may be necessary to estimate the total weight or the total number of units \\n(especially tablets) in a popul ation. The extrapolated weight will be determined using \\nindividual unit weights, the mean, and the stan dard deviation. The extr apolated number of \\nunits can be determined using the total populat ion weight and the weight of a known number \\nof units. The use of these estimates/extrapol ations will be made clear in the report. \\n \\nSAFETY CONSIDERATIONS \\nStandard Laboratory Practices \\n PREPARATIONS \\nNo additional preparations are necessary. \\n INSTRUMENTATION \\nENFSI Sampling Software (Second Edition, dated July 2017) \\n  MINIMUM STANDARDS and CONTROLS \\n1. The calculated values for th e mean and standard devia tion will be noted on the \\nworksheet/work notes.  \\n2. A copy of the estimation of weight spreadsheet will be included in the case file. \\n 3. The report will reflect that the weight is calcul ated, or the number of units estimated, as \\napplicable to the case. \\n \\nPROCEDURE – DETERMINATION OF THE NUMBER OF UNITS \\nThe total number of units in the population (e .g. tablets) may be ma nually counted. If the \\npopulation is large, the population number may be determined using the following: \\n \\n1. The weight of the total p opulation will be recorded. \\n \\n2. The weight of a known quantity of units will be recorded. \\n \\n3. The weight of the known quantity divided by th e number of units in that quantity will be \\ndone.  \\n4. The results of the division will  be divided into the total we ight of the population and the \\nresult will be the extrap olated number of units. \\n \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

The number of units to be tested (sample size), as determined by the sampling plan \\n(Hypergeometric or Bayesian),  will be individually weig hed. These weights will be \\nrecorded in an Excel spreadsheet. \\n \\n2. The mean (or average, \\uf06d) of the sample size weights will be calculated using Excel \\n(AVERAGE).  \\n3. The standard deviation of the sample size  weights will be cal culated using Excel \\n(STDEV.P).  \\n4. Enter the values in the ENFSI software Estimation of Weight panel. \\n \\na. Enter the confidence level (0.95) \\nb. Enter the population (90% of the total population) \\nc. Enter the sample size \\nd. Enter the mean \\ne. Enter the standard deviation \\nf. Enter the number of negatives (0) \\ng. Enter the weighing balance unc ertainty (calculated using the average weight of the \\nsample size in the appropriate Measurement Uncertainty Worksheet) \\nh. Report the calculated weight of the appr opriate number of units (90% of the \\npopulation for Hypergeometric or the tota l population for Bayesi an), ensuring the \\nrange is sufficiently above the necessary weight limit \\n \\n** The total population is not necessarily the same (N) value that was used in the \\nsampling plan calculation. The total population (N) is the total population of that item (sub-item).  For one calculation, (N\\n1) would represent the positive \\npopulation, for the next calculation (N 2) would represent the not analyzed \\nportion. [Where th e called population (N 1) + the not analyzed portion (N 2) = \\nthe total population (N).] \\n   \\nFor example:  \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

When utilizing the Bayesian sampling plan, \\nthe total population is 1000 for determination of weight. If the Hypergeometric sampling \\nplan was utilized at 90% of the population, the determinati on of weight would then be \\nperformed twice: the first time with a total population (N) of 900, and the second time \\nwith the remaining population (N) of 100. This may also be applied by using the total \\npopulation of 1000, then the call ed population of 900, and by difference determine, the \\ncalculated weight of the 100 pack ets of the remaining population. \\n    REPORT WORDING \\nThe following are examples of descriptors that cl arify that the number of  units or the weight \\nwas extrapolated/estimated. When statistics are used for weight  determination, use the word \\n“calculated.” For unit number determin ations use the word “estimated.” These are only \\nexamples and not an exhaustive li st.

The GC-IR combin es a chromatography separation technique \\nwith confirmatory structural information fro m the infrared spectrometer, allowing for the \\npositive identification of a compound. While the GC-IR would likely not be the first step \\nin the analytical process for routine casewo rk, it could be employed for difficult cases \\nthat involve identical-looking GC/MS spectra or co-eluting positional isomers.  The \\ninstrument can be used with an automated sampler.  The qualitative analysis of unknown substanc es by GC-IR is accomplished by direct \\ncomparison with a standard spectrum for an identification.  Comparis on of retention time \\ndata generated by the GC can be used as a pr eliminary test. Identifi cations made using the \\nFT-IR rely on comparisons of peak positio ns and relative peak intensities between \\nsamples and standard spectra. When retention time data is used in conjunction with \\ninfrared spectral data, a GC-IR run is still considered a single test for the purposes of meeting the minimum requi rement of two tests. \\n   Sample preparation may or may not require extraction.  Due to the separating power of \\nthe GC, the same vial run on the GC-MS can al so be run on the GC-IR.  The computer is \\nused to acquire data in a form  that can be used by the che mist.  It should not alter the \\nfundamental data.   If the analysis cannot occur at the originating laboratory, a re presentative sample of the \\nsubstance and/or vial with dried sample is necessary to perform GC-IR analysis. Sample \\npreparation will be performed at the origina ting laboratory, and then transferred to the \\nclosest laboratory with an instrument in serv ice for analysis to be completed.  The sample \\nworkflow is provided below.   \\nSAFETY CONSIDERATIONS \\n Standard Laboratory Practices  \\nUse personal protective equipm ent to cover eyes and skin  while working with liquid \\nnitrogen.  \\nPREPARATIONS \\n  The samples should be dissolved in a suitabl e solvent, e.g., methanol, chloroform, etc. \\n \\nINSTRUMENTATION \\n \\n Dani Gas Chromatograph with autosampler \\n  DiscovIR Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

Documentation \\n \\n1. A copy of the GC-IR blank report shall be  included before each sample run.  \\n2. A copy of the GC-IR sample report, which includes both the chromatogram and \\nthe spectrum, will be included in the cas e file for each sample run.  Using the \\nPrint Report workbook, at least two peaks will  be labeled with the wavenumber of \\nthe apex.  These peaks should be within the 2000 – 1300 cm\\n-1 region, whenever \\npossible.  The peaks selected for labeling sh all correlate directly to the peaks used \\nfor comparison to a referen ce standard.  The print out of the reference standard \\nwith peaks labeled will also be included.   \\n3. The gas chromatography conditions, incl uding column type (included in the \\nmethod name or analytical notes pa cket - not included by software) and \\ndimensions, injection temperature, injection volume, split ratio, oven \\ntemperatures, oven ramps, hold times, gas flow, transfer line temperature, \\nrestrictor temperature, and IR parameters including disk  temperature, disk speed, \\ndata collection time, track pointer, and cham ber pressure will be on the report.    \\n4. The item number, analyst’s initials, and date  will be recorded on the report and all \\nspectra.  Item number is optiona l on the standards and blanks. \\n5. The worksheet will indicate the result of the IR and any additional spectra will be \\nreferenced to the worksheet (excluding standards).  Chromatograms and spectra \\nshall be traceable to the GC-IR from whic h they were generated.  Data that is \\nNOT suitable for comparison, but is in cluded in the case file, must be \\ndistinguishable from data that is suitable for co mparison.  This can be \\naccomplished by associating samples with their corresponding spectra and results \\nin the “Notes” panel in LIMS or thr ough annotations on the included spectra. \\n \\nII. Screening parameters \\n \\n1. Per the manufacturer, the IR screeni ng parameters are as follows:   \\nScan:   1 (real time) as o pposed to number of scans  \\nResolution: 4 cm -1 \\nStarting wavenumber:  4000 cm-1 \\nEnding wavenumber:  700 cm-1 \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

For a general screening run, the injection volume will be 1 micro liter (2 microliters, \\nif needed) and the split ratio will be between 5:1 and 20:1. \\na. “Weak” methods that alter the split ratio  or injection volume to allow more \\nsample onto the column are acceptable fo r use after a general screening run has \\nbeen attempted or determined  based on previous GC-MS run. \\nb. Methods tailored for the identification of a particular drug (or class of drugs) are \\nexempt from these requirements. \\n \\nIII. Comparisons \\n \\n1. Any qualitative comparison(s) will be made  to in-house standards after the data \\nhas been assessed for su itability (see DC-App II). \\n2. Spectral comparisons \\na. For spectral comparisons (including positive identification, standard \\nreference, and documentation cr iteria) refer to DC-F-1/III. \\n3. Retention time comparisons \\na. For retention time comparisons (incl uding positive indications, standard \\nreference, and documentation cr iteria), refer to DC-D-1/III. \\n  \\nIV. Function Checks/Po sitive Controls \\n1. A logbook (or online equivalent) will be kept for the instru ment to record \\nmaintenance, function (QC) checks, positive controls, standards for comparisons, \\nand column installation date.  \\na. A polystyrene standard will be run at least once a month or before \\noperation if not used on a routine ba sis. The results of this function \\ncheck are preserved in a data ta ble on the instrument.  A passing \\nfunction check will have at least tw o polystyrene wavenumbers between \\n2000 and 1300 cm-1 fall within 1 cm-1 of the associated NIST reference \\nwavenumbers.  A copy of this tabl e (to include the NIST reference \\nnumbers and the current polystyrene run) will be maintained in the \\nlogbook (or online equivalent).     \\nb. The GC-IR has two function checks (referred to as QC tests) that should be performed prior to the first sequence of the day: \\n1. Align (throughput) test - The pur pose of this test is to \\nensure that the instrument is operating optimally.  The \\nresults shall be between 4 and 8 volts, with ideal readings \\nbeing between 5 and 7 volts.  \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

Signal-to-Noise test- This test will help determine if the \\nbackground is interfering with  the sample signal.  The \\ninstrument runs this test five  times.  The average result of \\nthese is normally between 0.5 and 1.0 with a maximum upper limit of 1.5. If the signal-to -noise ratio is above 1.5,   \\nthen the test will be completed again. If the second test fails, then contact vendor for further assistance. \\nc. Positive controls shall be run at leas t monthly, or before operation if not \\nused on a routine basis   \\n1. A program to be used as a general drug screen or unknown run will be checked by running low and high boiling standards.  A general screen ing run shall demonstrate the \\nability to detect both GHB (or GBL) and Buprenorphine (or Trazodone.)  Any change to this method (GC or IR \\nparameters) will require a new positive control to be run. \\n2. The control spectra will be peak-picked and compared to \\nprevious peak-picked spectr a and maintained in the \\ninstrument logbook (or online equivalent).  Deviations greater than +/- 1 cm\\n-1 of prominent peak s in the 2000-1300 \\ncm-1 region from the prior function check will need to be \\nconsidered.  Trending deviations  should be investigated and \\naddressed. \\n3. The chromatogram must be compared to a previously \\naccepted control or reference material and examined for \\npeak shape, height, and retent ion time reproducibility.   \\n.   \\n \\nPROCEDURE OR ANALYSIS \\n \\n1. A background spectrum (collected with ever y run) should be included in the GC-\\nIR report.  \\n2. A blank is required prior to every samp le run on the GC-IR, and the report for \\neach blank will be includ ed in the case file.  \\n3. Each sample will be run immediately follo wing a blank and will be set to overlay \\non the same disc location as  its associated blank.   \\n \\nSAMPLE SCREENING/UNKNOWN PROGRAM \\nThe following method is an example of a genera l drug screen.

Howeve r, depending on the situation, it may not be \\nnecessary to reduce each sample to a uniform mesh size. The experience of the analyst will \\ndetermine this as well as the purpose of the an alysis (qualitative or quantitative). Minimum \\nStandards and Controls are not to be used as  a substitute for good scientific procedures. On \\nan individual case, the minimum indicated may not suffice to co mplete the identification as \\ndefined. It is the primary responsibility of th e chemist to identify the controlled substance \\nrather than fulfill these standards.  After evidence handling procedur es have been completed and the mass determined for the \\nsample, a portion can be selected for analysis . The requirement to use less than 50% of the \\nsample in the analysis can be exceeded if th e analysis dictates it. However, for small \\namounts, it may be necessary to save the ex tracted material used  in the analysis. \\n Once the sample is ready for analysis, the anal yst must select the procedures necessary to \\ndetect and positively identify or eliminate the presence of any controlled substances. This \\nchoice is left up to the analyst as long as th e result meets the requi rements listed in the \\ngeneral introduction to the analys is of controlled substances. The results of the analysis will \\nbe reported as indicated in Appendix I – Report Wording. \\n SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS \\nFollow the requirements of selected procedure. \\n PREPARATIONS \\nFollow the requirements of each procedure.

Each of these has pa rticular handling or \\nextraction procedures, but all are analyzed in a si milar manner after isolation of the controlled \\nsubstance from the initial matrix. The followin g are some general extr action procedures for \\nthe analysis of these types of samples. \\n \\nLiquids: \\n Sometimes can be extracted using chloroform or similar organic solvent. The addition of dilute acid or base solutions to the initial aqueous matrix can assist both the extraction and help in diluting the sample. Other procedures can be found in the Appendix III under Extractions and \\nSeparations.  \\nPaper:  This usually consists of LSD, an NBOMe compound, or a synthetic Cannabinoid applied to various types of paper. The sample can be directly extracted with an organic solvent and sonication or extracted \\nwith ammonium hydroxide solution and chloroform. See Appendix III for other extractions. Generally, th e paper being analyzed should be \\nweighed in its entirety and reporte d appropriately. There may also be \\ntimes when the paper can be considered a residue. When that occurs, the analyst will analyze and report the paper as a residue.   \\nResidues: These can be analyzed with va rious wash techniques e.g. methanol, and \\nthe volume reduced prior to analysis. In  order for residues to be analyzed, \\na request from the State’s Attorn eys Office must be submitted and \\napproved by the Lab Director or designee.  \\nNon-Cannabis Plant Material: These may require some blending, gr inding, or sample reduction of the \\nplant tissue prior to extraction. Once  the matrix is br oken down, organic \\nsolvents and extractions can sometim es help remove the controlled \\nsubstance.  \\nFood Products: Food products vary from candies spotted with suspected LSD or \\nNBOMe, gummy candies containing benzodiazepines, to commercially \\nprepared foods containing THC.  Ca re should be taken to minimize the \\nimpact of the sample matrix on instrumentation through careful \\npreparation and extractions.    \\n SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS \\nFollow the requirements of selected procedure. \\n  \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

There are two methods for quantitation \\nby GC, the external and internal standard methods.  The columns, conditions for the gas chromatogr aph, solvents and inte rnal standards should \\nbe chosen based on the sample being tested. These factors are left to the discretion of the \\nchemist.  Solvents should be chosen that will insure total dissolution of the substance being quantitated. In many cases chloroform is preferred over methanol because sugars are \\ngenerally insoluble in the chloroform. A mixture  of chloroform and methanol can also be \\nused.  To insure that the entire samp le injected into the GC is being measured, care must be taken \\nto insure that sodium and sulfate salts are di ssociated fully. This probl em can be eliminated \\nby adding either a drop of acetic acid or sodi um hydroxide to the solution before injection \\nonto the gas chromatograph.  Multiple injections of the standard should be made to insure reproducibility of the system \\nand method. A concentration curve of sta ndards ranging from 0.5 mg/mL to 1.5 mg/mL can \\nbe done to test the linearity. \\n SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS \\nStandard Laboratory Practices in cluding the use of solvents. \\n PREPARATIONS \\nPreparations for Intern al Standard Procedure \\n \\n1. Prepare the internal standard solution. \\n \\nThe internal standard solution should be  at a concentration of approximately 1 \\nmg/mL. A large enough quantity should be made in order to  dilute all samples (the \\nstandard and the unknown solu tions). The internal standa rd should elute at an \\nappropriate time, have no interferences, and provide a reproducible peak for quantitation. Examples of hydrocarbons which can be used as internal standards are tetracosane, docosane, nonadecane. Other s ubstances could be used - for example \\npropiophenone (P-1-P) can be used for qua ntitating methamphetamine or dipentyl \\nphthalate for cocaine. \\n    \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

Prepare the standard solution. \\n \\nA primary standard should be used. An ex act amount is weighed on an analytical \\nbalance, recorded, and diluted with intern al standard by using a repipetter or \\nvolumetric flask. The concentration of th e standard should be approximately 1 \\nmg/mL. \\n \\n3. Prepare the unknown solution. \\n \\nThe salt form of the unknown should be determ ined by the analyst. If it is a different \\nsalt than the standard being used, adjustments for the differences in molecular \\nweights must be performed. \\n \\nThe sample must be made  homogenous before any an alysis is performed. The \\nunknown solution is prepared in the same  manner as the standard solution. The \\nconcentration of the substa nce being quantitated should be approximately 1 mg/mL. \\n To determine the amount of unknown sample to use, its pu rity is approximated. To \\nobtain a 1 mg/mL sample, the following table can be used: \\n \\nEstimated Purity \\n Amount sample (for 1 mL \\ninternal standard solution \\n \\n10% \\n \\n25% \\n \\n50% \\n \\n75% \\n \\n100% 10.0 mg \\n \\n4.0 mg \\n \\n2.0 mg \\n \\n1.3 mg \\n \\n1.0 m g \\n  \\nPreparations for External Standard Procedure \\nThe unknown and standard solutions  are made as in the internal standa rd method except \\nan internal standard solution is not use d. The unknown and standard are each diluted \\nwith solvent only. Both resulting solutions ar e injected on the gas chromatograph and the \\nareas of the resulting peaks are obtained. \\n INSTRUMENTATION \\nBalance  GC with or without autosampler \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

Quantitation will be perfor med using proven methods. \\n \\nThe GC Program used for quantitation will depend upon the substances being quantitated and vary with the column diameter  and the conditions. It is impractical to list \\nall of the possible combinations.  An example of a program for the quantita tion of cocaine on an Agilent 6890 is given \\nbelow: \\n \\nInstrument: Detector: Injector: Column: Other Conditions: Length of Run: Agilent 6890 FID - 280° 250° HP-1, 15 meter, 0.53 mm diameter, 2.65 micron coating 210° isothermal; split 10:1 ; flow 11.7 mLs/min Helium \\nApproximately 3 minutes  \\n \\n \\n2. Quantitation will be performed only upon approval by laboratory management of both the submitting laboratory and the centralized  quantitation laboratory. For the Forensic \\nScience Center at Chicago, this is the Sect ion Chief or appropriate  designee. Only one \\nsingle item will be quantitated.  \\n3. Calculations will be performed using onl y scientifically approved methods. All \\nquantitation results will be reported to two significant figur es (i.e. a sample of 56.75% \\nwill be reported as 56% and a sample  of 5.67% will be reported as 5.6%) \\n \\n4.

In addition, visual checks of the volumetric glassware will be done prior to \\neach use and any damaged volumetrics will be discarded.  \\n7. A control chart must be prepared and measur ement uncertainty determined (as outlined \\nin Appendix V) for a quantitation procedur e and drug before such analysis can be \\nperformed in casework.  \\n8. A control sample must be analyzed with each case (as outlined in Appendix V). The control should come fro m the same stock that was used to  create the control chart. If that \\ncontrol sample is unavailable, a new sample must be prepared and a new control chart \\ncreated.  \\n9. The control sample must fall with in 2 standard deviations (2 σ) on the control chart for \\nthe analysis to be valid. \\n PROCEDURE OR ANALYSIS \\nProcedure for Internal Standard Method \\n An internal standard is added to the unknown, control, and the standard solutions. Each \\nsolution is injected on the gas chromatograp h and the areas of the resulting peaks are \\nobtained. These peak areas and the weights of the unknown sample  and standard are used to \\ncalculate the purity of the sample. Calculations are performed as described below.  Multiple injections of the standard, control and unknown are made. Each solution should be \\nrun at least twice. The integration of th e areas of the eluted peaks is recorded. \\n Calculation \\n The responses of the standard and the unknown are normalized to the internal standard using \\nthe peak areas from the GC chromatogram.  Rstd = Area standard/Area of its internal standard  Runk = Area unknown/Area of its internal standard  Multiple runs are calculated separately and then averaged together. These average R values are inserted in the following formula to determine the concentration of the unknown: \\n \\n \\n \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.   Accepted Date:   September 13, 2024 \\nDrug Chemistry Procedures Manual DC-IIA-3 \\nPage 6 of 7 \\nVersion 2024.09.13 Procedure:    Quantitation by Gas Chromatography \\n The symbol X provides the units for the quantita tion. If X is 100%, the calculation is percent \\nas the standard salt. If X is the average weig ht of a tablet, the calculation is mg of the \\nstandard salt per tablet. If X is  1, the calculation is mg/mL. \\n \\nIf the salt form of the unknown and the standard are different, adjustments for the \\ndifferences in molecular weights must be pe rformed. The final result is multiplied by the \\nmolecular weight of the salt form of the unknown and divide d by the molecular weight of \\nthe standard salt form.  Rather than weighing a single standard at 1 mg /mL, a range of standards can be prepared \\nand injected to create a standard curve. The concentrations of the standard samples and the \\nareas of the eluted peaks are used to create a calibration table. This table is stored on the computer. The unknown is then prepared and in jected. The areas of the eluted peaks are \\ncompared back to the table to determine the amount of unknown in the sample. No manual \\ncalculations are necessary. \\n \\nProcedure for External Standard \\n This procedure is similar to th e internal standard method except  that no internal standard is \\nadded to the solutions. This method is reliable if automatic in jection techniques are used to \\ninsure reproducibility. The calculations assume  that the injection size for both the unknown \\nand the standard are the same. If not, the calcu lations must correct the responses for this \\ndifference.  Calculation \\n Multiple runs are performed and the resulting peak areas averaged. The following formula is used to determine the co ncentration of the unknown: \\n \\n \\n \\nThe symbol X is defined in the internal st andard method. If the in jection sizes of the \\nstandard and unknown are not equal, the area of  each must be norma lized by dividing by its \\ninjection size. \\n REPORT WORDING \\nSee Appendix I - Report Wording. \\n   \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

With selected ion monito ring (SIM) the mass spectrometer is directed \\nto scan only a preselected range or number of masses. Because of this, the mass spectrometer \\nspends its signal collection time only on masses of interest. On e can take advantage of this \\nincreased signal to noise ratio to enhance the sensitivity of the instrument. In addition to \\nincreased sensitivity, the SIM Method also is used to quantitate samples. This is the purpose of this method. An example of this type of analysis for me thamphetamine quantitation is \\npresented below. SIM quantitation can be used fo r other drugs, e.g., cocaine, heroin, etc., with \\nthe appropriate internal standard. \\n SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS \\nStandard Laboratory Practices in cluding the use of solvents. \\n PREPARATIONS \\nReagents \\nPropiophenone (P-1-P) Chloroform Methamphetamine HCl (Crystalline) Sodium Hydroxide    0.5 N NaOH solution – 20 grams of Sodium H ydroxide pellets or flakes are dissolved \\nwith 1 liter of distilled water. This will generate some heat and should be done with \\nstirring. \\n  \\nPreparations for Intern al Standard Procedure \\n \\n1. Prepare the internal standard solution. \\nAn internal standard solution of propiophe none (P-1-P) is prepared by adding 1.3 mL of \\nP-1-P and diluting to 1 liter with chlorofo rm. This is the base for all solutions. \\n 2. Prepare the standard solution. \\n A standard solution of methamphetamine HCl is prepared by adding 25 mg of primary \\nstandard to 25 mL of previously prepared internal standard solution. Any amount can be \\nprepared as long as the 1 mg/mL ratio is kept.   \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

Volumetric glassware used for the prep aration of quantitation samples will be \\nchecked through the appropriate creation of  a calibration curve and analysis of \\npositive control samples. In addition, visu al checks of the volumetric glassware \\nwill be done prior to each use and any da maged volumetrics will be discarded. \\n \\n7. A control chart must be prepared and measurement uncertainty determined for a quantitation procedure and specific drug befo re such analysis can be performed in \\ncasework.  \\n8. A control sample must be analyzed with each case. The control should come from \\nthe same stock that was used to create th e control chart. If that control sample is \\nunavailable, a new sample must be prep ared and a new control chart created. \\n \\n9. The control sample must fall w ithin 2 standard deviations (2 σ) on the control chart \\nfor the analysis to be valid. \\n PROCEDURE OR ANALYSIS \\nOnce the solutions (standard, sample, and control)  have been prepared they are extracted in \\nthe following manner:  \\n1. Approximately 1 mL of solution is placed in a culture tube (about 1/3 of a 10 \\nx 75 mm size) and an equal amount of 0.5 N NaOH is added and mixed together.  \\n2. The tube is centrifuged and the chloroform layer removed. This chloroform is \\ncentrifuged twice more to remove water.  \\n3. The chloroform solution is transferred to an autosampler vial. \\n The vial is placed on mass spect rometer for analysis.

The observed color change and transfer will be documented on the worksheet to indicate results (e.g. purple / purple). \\n PROCEDURE OR ANALYSIS \\nThe Duquenois-Levine test is conducted in three steps: \\n \\nStep 1:  Extract the sample using petroleu m ether. Other solvents, such as methanol, \\nhexane, chloroform, or methylene chloride  may be used to extract the sample \\nwithout affecting the results of the test. \\n Step 2: Dry the extract, add Duquenoi s Reagent followed  by concentrated \\nHydrochloric Acid in approximately equal amounts. Wait up to 2 minutes \\nand note the color, if any, that develops. \\n Step 3:  Add chloroform. Note the color, if any, that transfers to the chloroform layer. \\n*See note on Chloroform in Preparations section. \\n Though the colors for this test are somewhat subjective, a positiv e result ranges from a blue \\nto purple for the top layer coupled  with a transfer of a purple  to blue color to the bottom \\nchloroform layer. The colors formed are due to  the concentrations of the various Cannabinoids \\npresent and can vary with the age and condition of the sample. \\n  REPORT WORDING \\nSee Appendix I - Report Wording. \\n  REFERENCES \\n1.

Data that is suitable for comparison meets the minimum standards and controls in addition to the requirements outlined in this Appendix.    \\n1. Data will be included in the case file and documented in LIMS per the policies of each technique.  \\n2. Data that provides informat ion with limitations (e.g. indi cations on a GC-MS, lack \\nof isomer differentiation, weak color tests,  etc.) is still suitable.  Results will be \\ndocumented per the policies of each t echnique to reflect any limitations. \\n \\nB. Data that does not meet the minimum standards and controls and/or the requirements outlined in this Appendix will be  considered rejected data. \\n \\n1. The decision to reject data will be made by the forensic scientist authoring the report. \\ni. If the suggestion to reject data is ma de by a technical reviewer, this will \\nbe succinctly documented in the ro uting history through the rejection \\nof the case. \\n \\n2. For techniques which produce instrumental data, the data itself will be clearly identified as rejected and included in the casefile as delineated in the Quality \\nManual (QM-12).  \\n3.

If the data does not meet \\nestablished minimum standard s and controls, or there is no data acquired, then the \\nassociated data will be rejected fo r comparison to a reference standard. \\n \\n2. In order to utilize acquired data for comparison, all associ ated blanks and controls \\nwill meet the minimum standards and controls applicable to the technique(s) \\nemployed. \\ni. If the blanks and controls do not  meet the established minimum \\nstandards and controls, then the asso ciated data will be rejected for \\ncomparison to a re ference standard. \\n \\nB. Detector Response \\n \\n1. When using a technique that produces a de tector response, the response will be at \\nleast three times the noise level to be cons idered a peak suitable for comparison to \\na reference standard.  The short-term noise  levels (those directly adjacent to the \\nsignal response) are used for determin ing response suitability.  If a visual \\nassessment does not clearly demonstrate a signal-to-noise  ratio greater than 3:1, \\nthen a mathematical technique will be employed.  (Use of chromatographic data processing software to determine sign al-to-noise ratios is acceptable.) \\ni. If the response is not at least three times the noise level to be considered a peak, the data will be rejected fo r comparison to a reference standard. \\n  \\nC. Chromatographic Peak Shape \\n \\n1. Acceptable peaks are typical ly Gaussian, but slight asymmetry and tailing is \\nnormal with temperat ure-gradient methods. In the event that a chromatographic \\npeak is not Gaussian, the analyst will eval uate the level of fronting or tailing to \\ndetermine the significance of the irregularity.   \\n \\n2. The peak of a single analyte usually produces a single apex to be used for comparison.  In the event of a split peak, a single distinct apex which is at least two times the height of any secondary apex not baseli ne resolved, may be used for \\ncomparison to a re ference standard. \\n \\ni. GC-FID: If the peak shape is considered unacceptable, the data will be rejected for comparison to a refere nce standard and mitigation steps \\nwill be taken upon reanalysis of the sample. \\nii. GC-MS: If the peak shape is consid ered unacceptable fo r retention time \\ncomparison, spectral data may still be utilized for comparison to a reference standard. \\n \\nD.

If multiple peaks are present, chromatographic resolution shall be sufficient to \\nevaluate a substance with minimal in terference from other substances or \\nimpurities. Resolution will also  be sufficient to differen tiate between IR bands and \\nmass assignments.  Analysts will assess the extent to which any potential overlap \\naffects identification of a specific analyte to the excl usion of interferences as \\nfollows.   \\ni. Baseline resolution between multiple peaks is recommended.  At minimum, adjacent chromatographic peaks must have discernable \\napexes.   \\nii. Data processing procedures can be used (e.g., spectral subtractions, \\nextracted ion chromatogram, etc.). \\niii. If the resolution is not sufficient to show separation, th en the associated \\ndata will be rejected for comp arison to a reference standard. \\n \\nIII. For Non-Instrumental Techniques (TLC, Color Tests) \\n \\nA. Blanks and Controls  \\n1. Required blanks and controls will meet the minimum standa rds and controls \\napplicable to the technique(s) employe d to utilize the associated data for \\ncomparison. \\ni. If the blanks and controls do not  meet the established minimum \\nstandards and controls, then the asso ciated data will be rejected for \\ncomparison to a re ference standard. \\n \\nB. Color Tests  1. Visually assess the results for the presence or absence of positive test indications (color changes) as defined by minimum st andards and controls or in comparison \\nto a primary reference standard. \\ni. The absence of response will not be used as a preliminary test for the positive identification of a controlled substance.  \\nii. Reasons for color test data to be rejected may include: \\na. a reagent batch is expired  \\nb. the reagent fails quality checks  \\nc. a substance known to inhibit color is present in the sample (e.g. \\ntableting dyes, DMSO, etc.)  \\n \\nC.

If the desired component is soluble in the solvent and the other components are not, \\nthe solvent can be separated from the insoluble, ei ther by filtering or using a centrifuge. This solvent \\nis then dried down to yield the desired component .

These functional groups usually cause peak tailing or loss of  response due to the \\ninteractions of the functional group s with liners, or active sites on th e columns. This activity can be \\nreduced or eliminated by chemic ally converting active groups to inactive species. Derivatizing the \\nsample prior to using a gas ch romatograph or mass spectromet er would overcome problems in \\nidentification and characterization. \\n \\nSAFETY CONSIDERATIONS \\n Standard laboratory safety procedures for ha ndling corrosive materials and solvents. Special \\nhandling requirements are included with the material safety data sh eets and should be read prior to \\nthe use of these derivatizin g agents. \\n  \\n INSTRUMENTATION \\n Gas Chromato graphy with Flame Ionization De tection or Gas Chromato graphy-Mass Spectrometr y \\n  \\n MINIMUM STANDARDS AND CONTROLS \\n 1. \\n2. \\n   \\n3.

It is the primary responsibil ity of the chemist to identify the controlled substance ra ther than \\nsimply fulfill these standards.  \\nADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES A PPLICABLE TO ANY ANALYSES \\n A. Tests and Controls  \\n1. Routine Formulations, Standard Tests - Th ere is no need to include how tests are \\nperformed in the case file, as long as they are standard tests pe rformed routinely. The \\nsame reasoning applies to formulations of  reagents, solutions, and standard in-house \\nmethods. Many of these will be found in the chemistry section procedures manual or a laboratory’s chemistry section manual. \\n \\n2. All reference spectra /chromat ograms used for identification shall be included in the \\ncase file.  \\n \\n3. GC-FID and GC-MS Blank Policy \\n  \\nThe blank serves two primary f unctions: first, as a quality  check on the chemicals used \\nduring the sample preparation process and second, as a qua lity assurance measure for \\nmonitoring laboratory technique  and instrumentation.  For th e purposes of this policy, \\nlab case item or item refers to the parent it em received from an agency that may include \\none or more unknown units for analysis.  Unit(s) refers to the unknown object(s) \\nrequiring analysis received within the item.  Sample(s) refers to the analyzed portion(s) of the unit. \\n      \\na. When blanks need to be run: \\n \\nPrior to the sample run, at least one blank will be in jected per lab case item \\nunder the same conditions and method as the sample run(s). All consecutive \\nblanks between samples in multiple unit cases will be run using the same \\nconditions and method as th e sample runs.  This in cludes all instrument \\nparameters from the injection to detection. In cases where a trace or residue amount of a substance is suspected, a bla nk will be run immediately before the \\nsuspected trace or residue sample. If multiple units are analyzed, no more than ten samples will be run after a single blank.  \\n \\nb. Preparation of blanks: \\n \\nThe blank will be prepared in the same manner as the sample. This includes all solvents and reagents, including those for extraction and derivatization. Any \\nsolvent other than methanol must be not ed on the worksheet. If the sample is \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.   Accepted Date:    September 13, 2024 \\nDrug Chemistry Procedures Manual DC-App IV-A \\nPage 3 of 11 \\nVersion 2024.09.13 Appendix IV-A    Chemistry Minimum \\nStandards and Controls: Administrative Policies \\nApplicable to An y Anal yses \\n  diluted in an internal standard solu tion, the blank will be prepared from the \\ninternal standard solution. If the samp le is extracted, the blank will be \\nextracted. If the sample is concentrated prior to injection, the blank is to be \\nconcentrated as well. In such cases that a neat sample must be injected directly, the solvent chosen for th e blank should be documented on the worksheet. \\n \\nc. Blank acceptance: \\n \\nIf the blank has a peak at the same retention time as  the target compound, the \\nblank will be further evaluated for acceptability.  For GC-MS, noise that is attributed to column/septa bleed and/or  peaks that are attributed to solvent \\ncomponents do not invalidate the blank.  It  is also acceptable if the blank has \\npeaks at retention times other than  the target compound.  For GC-MS \\nchromatograms, any peak(s) present will be checked  and documented in the case file.    If the blank is determined to be unacceptable, the blank and unit(s) \\nwill be run again.  Raised gas chromatograph baselines also do not invalidate the blank. \\n    \\nd. Documentation: \\n \\nBlanks will be included in the working file and will be noted on the worksheet. In multiple unit cases, all consecutiv e blanks run between samples will be \\nincluded. Each blank for a case must be labeled in a way that specifies when (e.g., timestamp) it was run in  relation to the sample(s ). Labeling blanks with \\nthe item number is optional. \\n B. Evidence Handling Procedures \\n \\nThese are general procedures for the handling of Chemistry evidence. \\n \\n1. Seals \\n \\na. Whenever possible, all eviden ce is to be sealed when received, when placed in \\nthe vault and when not actually being an alyzed. If possible, handle evidence in \\na manner which preserves the integrity of the material inside and does not destroy or alter existing seals. \\n \\nb. After analysis, seals on internal packaging are only necessary to preserve the condition of the evidence (to prevent le akage or cross-co ntamination). All \\nexternal packages shall be sealed. The minimum marks needed on these exterior seals are initials and date. \\n \\n2. Markings \\n      \\na. All external packages of evidence will  contain the case nu mber, item number, \\ninitials and date. After analysis, inte rnal packaging will be marked with a \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

Any additional markings can be at \\nthe discretion of the analyst. The internal  packaging will then be sealed into an \\nouter package that is marked with th e case number, item number, date and \\ninitials. \\n \\n \\n \\nC. Analysis of Evidence  \\n1. When conducting casework, all observations, examinations and conclusions must be \\nrecorded and conducted in accordance w ith Command Directives guidelines. \\n \\n2. In general, it is not necessary to conduct an  analysis on each item submitted. Evidentiary \\nvalue and agency needs should dete rmine the extent of analysis. \\n \\n3. If possible, no more than half the evid ence shall be consumed in analysis. \\n \\n4. Every attempt shall be made to preserve evid ence. When the entire sample is used, extracts \\nmust be returned to the case. \\n \\n5. Per Command Directives ESH Appendix 16, field test kits are not to  be submitted as \\nevidence.  If a field test kit is found within sub mitted evidence, it wi ll be packaged to \\nprevent contamination of other evidence and returned to the agency. DO NOT DISCARD! \\n      \\nD. Mass Determination \\n     \\n1. Balances will be checked weekly using masse s across the range of the balance, including \\nthose listed in QM-11, according the table below. \\n \\nBalance Capacit\\ny Weights \\n200 g, 400 g 0.1 g, 1 g, 10 g, 200 g \\n500 g, 610 g 0.1 g, 1 g, 10 g, 500 g \\n4,000 g 0.1 g, 1 g, 10 g, 2,000 g \\n6,000 g, 8,000 g 500 g, 1,000 g 5,000 g \\n10,000 g, 32,000 g, 150,000 g 500 g, 5,000 g, 10,000 g \\n \\nThe examiner’s identity, date, and exact masses obtained will be r ecorded in a logbook \\n(or online equivalent). Balances  not used routinely will be checked monthly.  A balance \\ncheck will be effective for seven days.  Each laboratory will have a policy to follow should a balance fail to pass a standardized weight check. \\n \\na. Balances  and weight sets will be calibr ated by an ISO certified vendor on a routine \\nbasis as required by QM-11.  \\n     \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

The net mass of all substances will be dete rmined prior to analysis with the following \\nexceptions: \\n     \\na. Samples involving trace or re sidual amounts of material. \\n \\nb. Instances in which gross/estimated mass determination of numerous samples \\nindicates a mass less than legal limits as set by statute(s).  \\nc. Instances in which the net or gross/estimated mass far exceeds the maximum legal \\nlimits mass as set by statute(s). In this in stance, a sample with net mass exceeding \\nthe legal limit would suffice. \\n \\nd. Samples involving pharmaceutical prepara tions where preliminary identification \\nindicates a non-scheduled substance. \\n \\ne. Samples involving pharmaceutical prepara tions where preliminary identification \\nindicates a lower scheduled substance than a previously  identified higher schedule \\nsubstance. \\n \\nf. Cases involving the submission of indivi dual suspected Cannabis plants or the \\nsubmission of representative samples of  individual suspected Cannabis plants \\nwhere the agency plans to pursue charges based on the number of plants present, \\nnot the weight. \\n \\ng.  For cases involving large amounts of evidence (e.g. powders, chunky substances, \\netc.), a gross weight will be obtained a nd the evidence will be screened. Instances \\nwhere indications of a highly potent substanc e that may pose a risk to the analyst’s \\nsafety are present (e.g. carfentanil),  no further weighing will take place. \\n \\nh. The vessel used to weigh the evidence will not exceed the size/boundaries of the balance pan. \\n \\na. If a single unit (i.e. one large bundle of plant material) exceeds the size/boundaries of the balance with the largest pan, the unit will be weighed \\nin portions.  Each weight will be re corded and added t ogether for a total \\nnet weight of one unit.  Justificatio n for the division wi ll be documented \\non the worksheet. \\n \\n3. The balance reading should be record ed using the following conventions: \\n \\na. The mass will be reported to the 0.1 gram decimal place when the balance used permits. Never round off the balance read ings. Record all numbers read from the \\nbalance on the worksheet. For the report, the additional digits are dropped e.g, a \\nbalance reading of 553.1 grams will be re ported as 553.1 grams, a balance reading \\nof 10,352 grams will be reported as 10,352 gr ams and a balance reading of 1.341 \\ngrams will be reported as 1.3 grams.

At a weight  class, truncation occurs \\nafter the final digit significant to the char ge determination e.g., a balance reading \\nof 1.008 grams will be reported as 1.008 grams for a 1 gram weight class and a \\nbalance reading of 1.032 grams is reported as 1.03 grams fo r a 1 gram weight class. \\n \\nb. Less than one gram is singular and shall be preceded by a zero to indicate the placement of the decimal. Example: 0.1 gram. Note: One gram is included as \\nsingular. \\n \\nc. If the mass is less than 0 .1 gram, it shall be reported as “less than 0.1 gram”. For \\nsmaller amounts, an option is to report it as a residue. \\n \\nd. If the charge is affected in a multiple ite m, truncating must occur after the addition \\nof the masses of the items. \\n \\ne. Rolled cigarettes/cigars are weighed in thei r entirety. If a filter is present, remove \\nit prior to mass determ ination. The plant material is not separated from the paper. \\n \\nf. Legitimate pharmaceutical capsules are weighed in their entirety. For clandestine capsules, the capsule material is to be treated as packaging. An exception can be \\nmade for substances that are subject to  a dosage unit count in Illinois statutes. \\n \\n4. Measurement uncertainty will be calculated per Appendix V. \\n E. Sampling \\n \\n1. When possible, the analyst shall take a repr esentative sample on which to perform tests. \\n \\n2. It is not necessary to test ev ery item in a case in order to  make a determination about the \\npresence of Cannabis or a Controlled Substance. Sample requirements for multiple item \\ncases are listed in the Sampli ng Plan under Section H (DC-H-1). \\n     F. Worksheet  \\n1. The worksheet shall be a summary of all tests done a nd their results.  \\n \\na. Identification of the instrume nt and balance used in the analysis will be noted in \\nthe case records  \\n \\n2.

If a quantitative drug st andard is to be stored, \\nthe expiration date and/or re-authent ication date will also be recorded. \\n \\n2. When first used, IR, MS, or other approved techniques will be run, and the \\nspectrum will be used to authenticate and verify the identity of the drug with literature and/or in -house standards. \\n \\na. For qualitative standards, no expira tion dates will be assigned. Some \\nstandards might have dates a ssigned by the manufacturer. The \\ncontinued use of the standards in ob taining IR and MS data serves to \\nverify that the standards are fit fo r use. As long as the data obtained \\nfrom drug standard can serve to veri fy the identity of the standard, it \\ncan be used past any manufact urer supplied expiration date. \\n \\nb. Drug standards that are used in quan titative work will be assigned an \\nexpiration date if not supplied with  one by the manufacturer. The date \\nwill not be more than five years from the date of receipt. All quantitative drug standards can be re -authenticated; th e newly assigned \\nexpiration date will not be more than 5 years from the date of re-authentication.  \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

Any standard that is deemed to be  unfit for use will be discarded. \\n \\n3. Primary standards are defined as t hose obtained from legitimate sources. \\nSecondary standards are those obtained from other sources and verified in-\\nhouse; these standards should be kept to a minimum.  \\n \\n4. All controlled standards (primary and secondary) will be inventoried yearly. \\nThose over 1 gram will be weighed a nd recorded.  Documentation of the \\nannual inventory will be recorded in LAM. \\n \\nB. Literature Sources and External Standard References \\n \\n1. If no in-house drug  standard is available fo r comparison, li terature and \\nexternal sources may be referenced.  In determining the legitimacy of external sources, analysts should consider the credibility and qualifications \\nof the author, publication and format  of the reference (e.g. scholarly \\njournals or internet sites), date  of publication or  acquisition, and \\naccompanying documentation (method parameters, lot numbers, etc.).   \\n 2. In general, library searches should not  be considered legitimate references \\nfor data comparisons.  Exceptions include peer-reviewed and published \\nlibraries or libraries created within the Command using tr aceable reference \\nmaterials.  Any library reference meeting these exceptions must be \\nevaluated for legitimacy and relevance similar to any literature or other \\nexternal reference.   \\n \\nC. Other Reference Materials  1. PFTBA – This reference material is us ed to tune a mass spectrometer. PFTBA \\nwill be obtained from ISO accredited vendors. Appropriate documentation, such as a certificate of an alysis, should be retained when available. The process \\nof tuning the mass spectrometer will se rve to authenticate the PFTBA reference \\nmaterial. Since the tune is verified ev ery time it is performed, the PFTBA can \\nbe used past a manufacturer provided expiration date. \\n \\n2. Polystyrene – This refere nce material is used during the function check for \\ninfrared spectrophotometers. It must be a traceable standard, from an ISO \\naccredited vendor, with appropriate documen tation. If the standard is provided \\nwith a manufacturer’s expiration date, th e standard may be re -authenticated to \\nextend the date in five year intervals. The new date and analyst’s identity should be included on the standard or in the logbook (or online equivalent). \\n \\n2. Reference Collections \\n \\nA.

All spectra included in su ch collection will be uniquely identified as to the \\nsubstance, its source (lot number or other identifier), and to the instrument on \\nwhich it was acquired. \\n \\n2. The collection will be kept within the Drug Chemistry section. \\n \\n3. The collection can be archived as ne eded according to local procedures. \\n \\nB. Sample collection for reagent testing  1. A collection of known materi als may be kept for the purposes of testing \\nreagents (color tests, TLC visualization sprays, etc.) \\n \\n2. These materials may be purchased or samples taken from casework. \\n \\n3. Each item in the collection will be uniquely identified.  \\n4. Access to the collection will be limited, and use will be limited to the testing \\nof reagents. \\n \\nH. Temperature Controlled Environments  \\n1. Temperature Checks \\na.  A temperature check of the refrigerator  and/or freezer will be completed monthly \\nand recorded in LAM. \\n1. Refrigerators must be kept between 2°C and 10°C (between 35°F and 50°F). \\n2. Freezers must be kept between -25°C and -10°C (between -13°F and 14°F). \\nb. If the temperature is out of the acceptabl e range, adjust the temperature dial if \\nnecessary and recheck. \\n1. If the temperature cannot be maintained within the specified range listed above for a period of 24 hours, all contents will be relocated to an appropriate working refrigeration unit. The refrigerator or freezer that was out of the acceptable temperature range will be placed out-of-service until it can be repaired or replaced. \\n2. Thermometers \\na.  Only thermometers with ISO/IEC 17025 Ce rtificate of Calibra tions may be used. \\nThese thermometers must be traceable to national or international standards (e.g. \\nNIST). The calibration certi ficate for each thermometer will be entered in the \\nLAM. The vendor’s calibration serves as  the performance check. The thermometer \\nmay be placed into use immediately a nd used until the e xpiration date on its \\ncertificate. \\n \\nI.

While the protocols, methods and procedure give directions for the analysis of Cannabis, there \\nare some specific administrative procedures dir ectly applicable to Cannabis analysis. These \\nvarious procedures are listed in this appendix.  The following are procedures associated with the identification of Cannabis: \\n \\nA. Positive Identification \\n \\n1. To identify plant material as Cannabis, tw o positive tests are accep table if one of the \\ntests provides structural confirmation (e.g. GC-MS).   Additional tests may be done \\nat the discretion of the analyst. The tests used for Cannabis analys is are listed below: \\n  \\n \\na. Duquenois-Levine (D-L) test – See DC-IIIA-2. \\n \\nb. FTIR – See DC-F-1. \\n \\nc. GC-FID – See DC-D-1. \\n \\nd. GC-IR – See DC-I-1. \\n \\ne. GC-MS – See DC-G-1. \\n \\nf. Macroscopic Examination – See DC-IIIA-1. \\n \\ng.

It is permissible to perform a microscopic examination in conjunction with \\nanother test that provides structural confirmation, howev er, it is not sufficient to \\nperform the macroscopic exa mination with any other tec hnique, even if the second \\ntechnique provides stru ctural confirmation. \\n    \\n2. It is not necessary to test ev ery item in a case in order to make a determination about \\nthe presence of Cannabis. Sample requirements for multiple item cases are listed in \\nthe Sampling Plan under Section H.  \\n3. Cases found to contain Cannabis will specify  the cannabinoid identified on the report. \\n \\n4. Other tests may be submitted at the discretion of the chemist as long as they meet the minimum standards and controls guidelines. \\n \\nB. E-cigarette cartridges  Because of the level of difficulty associated  with opening e-cigarette cartridges, as well \\nas the sheer volume necessary to meet weight  class limits, when one cartridge has been \\nanalyzed and found to contain a cannabinoid, no others will be tested. If  the one analyzed \\ncartridge does not contain a cannabinoid, the analyst will use his or her discretion to \\ndetermine if more items need to be analyze d. Further analysis on any remaining cartridges \\nsubmitted will be at the di scretion of laboratory manage ment and only completed if \\nrequested by the State’s Attorney’s Office.  The unanalyzed cartridges will NOT need a \\ngross or estimated weight. They will be reported as cartridges (additional description \\noptional) and a conclusi on of “Not Analyzed”. \\n \\nC. Not Cannabis or No Cannabis Found Determination \\n \\nAt least two negative tests ar e required to eliminate the po ssibility of the presence of \\nCannabis.  When “Not Cannabi s” or “No Cannabis Found” is the only determination \\nmade for a piece of evidence, one of these must be  an instrumental test that also eliminates \\nthe possibility of other controlled substan ces, including high molecu lar weight synthetic \\ncannabinoids.  It is not necessary to report “Not Cannabis” or “No Cannabis Found” when \\nanother substance is identified. \\n \\nD. No Analysis Determination \\n \\nWhen identifying Cannabis, the entire amount submitted does not need to be analyzed. \\nAnalysis need only be conducted to th e weight limits for Illinois penalties. \\n \\n \\nMINIMUM STANDARDS AND CONTRO LS FOR TESTING TECHNIQUES \\n Minimum standards and controls for each individu al procedure or testing technique can be found \\nin the relevant section of  the procedures manual.\\n \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

Substances \\ncontrolled via administrative rule are listed separa tely in the Illinois Administrative Code, Title \\n77, Chapter X, Subchapter e, Part 2070.  A dditionally, the Kratom Control Act, The \\nMethamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act, and the Methamphetamine Precursor Control Act are of interest to the Drug Chemistry Section. Th ese can be found in Chapter 720, \\nSections 642, 646, and 648 respectively of the Illinois Compiled Statutes.  While the protocols, methods and procedures gi ve directions for the analysis of suspected \\ncontrolled substances, there are many administra tive procedures which must be addressed and \\nwhich do not lend themselves to a specific analysis . These various procedur es are collected into \\nthis appendix.  The following are procedures asso ciated with the identification of  any substances, regardless of \\ntheir control status: \\n \\n \\nA. Positive Identification  \\n1. There are minimum tests necessa ry for the identification of a drug. Two tests must \\nbe used to confirm the presence of a dr ug. One test will includ e IR, MS or another \\napproved technique providing structural co nfirmation. The other test will be an \\napproved preliminary testing technique or  acceptable instrumental screening test \\nin which the drug is indicated.  \\n \\nIt is acceptable to use two mass spectra to meet the minimum test requirements only if the following conditions are met:  \\na. The second mass spectrometer is different from the first AND there is a column phase change. \\n \\nb. When a purchased reference standard is  available and the sample warrants \\nuse of two mass spectra (e.g. residues, complex mixtures, synthetic drugs), the mass spectral data will be used and, if they are the only tests used to \\nmake a determination,  a documented comparison of  retention time data \\nfor at least one of the ru ns will also be utilized. \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.   Accepted Date:   September 13, 2024  \\nDrug Chemistry Procedures Manual DC-App IV-C \\nPage 3 of 5 \\nVersion 2024.09.13 Appendix IV-C:    Chemistry Minimum \\nStandards and Controls: Administrative Policies \\nfor Controlled Substance Anal ysis \\n  \\nc. When purchased reference standards are unobtainable, the results of two \\nGC-MS runs will be compared to two literature sources and documented in the case file. Therefore, these case s are exempt from the retention time \\ncomparison requirement.   \\n \\nAdditional tests will be done at the discretion of  the analyst. \\n \\n2. It is not necessary to test every item in  a case in order to make a determination \\nabout the presence of a controlled substa nce. Sample requirements for multiple \\nitem cases are listed in the Sa mpling Plan under Section H. \\n 3. Any specialized analytical procedures used will be documented in the laboratory’s chemistry secti on manual or on the worksheet. \\n     \\nB. No Scheduled Substance Found Determinations  1. At least two different tests, excluding color tests, will be used that together eliminate \\nthe possibility of the sample containing a controlled substance.   \\na. Two GC-MSs must only be used when the sample warrants it (e.g. residues, complex mixtures).  \\ni. The second mass spectrometer is diff erent from the first AND there is \\na column phase change.  \\nii. Retention time data must be take n into consideration and documented \\nin the case file. When it is not appropriate to make a retention time comparison to a standard, e. g. no peaks are present, peaks do not meet acceptance criteria or peaks present do not correspond to a controlled substance, the reason the compar ison was not perfo rmed will be \\ndocumented.  This can be documen ted as “No relevant peaks for \\nretention time comparison”  or “No peaks of intere st for retention time \\ncomparison” or other wording that  acknowledges w hy the retention \\ntime data could not be ta ken into consideration. \\n \\n2. A determination of no scheduled substance found requires one test to be a general \\nscreening run on a GC-MS instrument. \\n 3. When testing shows possible indications of  a substance of in terest, for example \\nthrough weak color tests or a mass spect rum with the presence of major ions \\nassociated with a possible controlled substa nce, it is necessary for the analyst to \\ndocument an attempt to increase the sensitivit y of the analytical process. This can be \\nachieved in the following ways, often re sulting in additiona l testing beyond the \\nminimum two tests required: \\n \\na. An increase in sensitiv ity through sample prepar ation (e.g. use of more \\nsample, extraction and concentr ation to a microvial) or  \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

An increase in sensitivit y through instrumental t echniques (e.g. lower split \\nratio, increased injection vol ume, manual injections)  \\n \\n4. A determination of no scheduled substance found can be made without excluding all \\npossible controlled substances. Unless a dditional information is provided, only those \\ndrugs normally encountered in a labo ratory need to be eliminated. \\n \\n5. If the form of the item is not  consistent with the normal dosage form of a particular \\ncontrolled substance, then the presence of that controlled subs tance need not be \\neliminated unless analysis is requested by th e submitting agency (i .e., the presence of \\nLSD in white powders). \\n \\n6. “No scheduled substance found” is not an  acceptable finding when non-scheduled \\nsynthetic drugs are present in a sample and can be identified, either conclusively or \\npreliminarily. The use of “no scheduled subs tance found” should be primarily focused \\non cases including, but not limited to, non- scheduled pharmaceutical type compounds \\n(e.g. caffeine, acetaminophen, diphenhydramine,  etc.), cutting agents and tableting \\nmaterials (e.g. inositol, st earic acid), and samples w ith no compounds of interest \\npresent.  \\n \\nC. No Analysis Determination \\n \\n1. Not all items/units need to be analyzed. Unless additional information is provided, \\nthe chemist need only identi fy the amount of controll ed substance that would \\nbring the highest penalty for the defendant according to the appropriate statutes.  Once the highest penalty has been obtained, no further analysis will be done. \\n \\n2. Factory sealed and labelled containers of cutting agents need not be analyzed (i.e., \\ninositol, mannitol, baking soda, etc.). \\n \\n3. Non-controlled pharmaceuticals with id entifiable markings need not be \\nconfirmed through analysis unless there is  evidence of tampering or reasons to \\nsuspect a counterfeit. \\n \\n4. Factory sealed and labelled pharmaceutical  preparations and blister packs do not \\nneed to be opened or confirmed through analysis unless they are scheduled substances and either the only item in a case or the item with the highest penalty. \\n \\n5. In cases that are multi-unit, if the chem ist observes the samples to be similar, \\nrandomly removes one that tests negative, the one tested would be reported as \\nNSSF and the rest may be re ported as No Analysis or  Not Analyzed. For items \\nnot in commonly seen drug form (i.e., lima beans, marbles, rice), the one tested \\nwould be reported as NSSF and the rest ma y be reported as No Analysis or Not \\nAnalyzed. \\n \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

It is the primary  responsibility of the chemist to iden tify the controlled substance rather \\nthan simply fulfill these standards.   \\nADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES FOR SPECIFIC CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES \\n The Illinois Controlled S ubstances Act governs most substances c ontrolled in the state of Illinois. \\nThe act is found in Chapter 720, Section 570 of the Illinois Co mpiled Statutes. Substances \\ncontrolled via administrative rule are listed separa tely in the Illinois Administrative Code, Title \\n77, Chapter X, Subchapter e, Part 2070.  A dditionally, the Kratom Control Act, The \\nMethamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act, and the Methamphetamine Precursor Control Act are of interest to the Drug Chemistry Section. Th ese can be found in Chapter 720, \\nSections 642, 646, and 648 respectively of the Illinois Compiled Statutes.  While the protocols, methods and procedures gi ve directions for the analysis of suspected \\ncontrolled substances, there are some substances that require specific testing in order to make a \\npositive identification, sometimes going beyond the two-test minimum for a typical \\nidentification. These various procedures  are collected into this appendix. \\n   1. Psilocyn and Psilocybin  a. In order to distinguish and i ndependently identify psilocyn and/or psilocybin in a sample, \\none of the following methods will be employed:  i. A Weber color test (see DC-B -1) is sufficient to indicate the presence of psilocyn, \\nprovided the following criteria are met: 1. A primary psilocyn standard produc es a positive Weber test, AND \\n2. A primary psilocybin standard produ ces a negative Weber test, AND \\n3. Both standards for (1) and (2) are tested  on the same day as the sample(s), AND \\n4. Both standards for (1) and (2) are logg ed in the casefile  or a logbook (or the \\nonline equivalent). Documentation must  include lot numbers or laboratory \\ninventory number and color test results for each standard tested. Analysts may only use a verification performed by anothe r analyst if all of the above criteria \\nare met and the verification was logged in the logbook (or onl ine equivalent). \\nNote: If utilizing Weber reagent with a liquid extract, it must be a solvent only extract. \\nii. A prep TLC will be run indicating the presence of both psilocyn and psilocybin in a separated state, then at least one spot will be scraped and confirmed by either IR or GC/MS. \\niii. A solvent only extract will be run on TLC and if psilocyn and/or psilocybin are \\npresent in separated states, the sample will also be analyzed using GC-MS, GC-IR or \\nIR. \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

When a negative Weber color test is produ ced for a sample suspected to contain \\nhallucinogenic mushrooms, one of the other t echniques listed above shall be employed \\nto attempt to distinguish and independently identify ps ilocyn and/or psilocybin.   \\nc. If the analyst cannot distinguish between psilocyn and psilocyb in after attempting at least \\none of the techniques listed above, then  the results will be reported as: \\n \\nPsilocyn and/or Psilocybin. The specific compound(s) could not be differentiated.  \\n  \\n2. Salvinorin A  a. For the analysis and storage of Salvinorin A, the following guidelines are recommended: \\ni. Extract using methanol or chloroform. For le afy material, grind in  mortar and pestle, \\nshake or stir for one minute befo re removing the supernatant.   \\nii. For small sample amounts, use boiling ch loroform. Place the sample containing \\nchloroform in a water bath; choose a setting to boil the chloroform , but not the water; \\nevaporate the solvent to microvial volume. \\niii. Due to stability concerns, extracts sh ould be analyzed within 24 hours. \\niv. Salvinorin A standards must be stored in the refrigerator in light-resistant or applicable containers. \\n 3. Isomer determinations \\n \\na. Optical Isomers \\n \\ni. When Methorphan is identified  in a substance that cannot be physically identified as \\na pharmaceutical preparation, and it cannot be isolated in a state sufficiently pure for \\neffective optical isomer determination via polarimetry, then it is appropriate to \\nidentify Methorphan with a qualification that  informs the agencies that the optical \\nisomer of Methorphan could not be determined, however all of its isomers are listed \\nin the Illinois Compiled Statutes. \\nii. When Propoxyphene is identified in a substa nce that cannot be physically identified \\nas a pharmaceutical preparation, and it cannot be isolated in a state sufficiently pure \\nfor effective optical isomer determination via polarimetry, then it is appropriate to identify Propoxyphene with a qu alification that informs the agencies that the optical \\nisomer could not be determined. \\n \\nb. Positional Isomers \\n \\ni. Synthetic cathinones, canna binoids, opioids, and phene thylamines often have \\npositional isomers that produce similar mass spectral data. In order to identify a \\nspecific positional isomer, analysts must have the necessary data to support the identification.   \\nii. The following are options for identification o\\n f a positional isomer. (Note: not every \\noption will work for every dr ug. This is dependent on th e substance and instrument \\nparameters. More than one technique may be necessary.) \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

Mass spectral comparison of the sample to the standard of the different isomers \\n(or comparison of the mass spectra of the isomers to each other). \\n2.  Comparison of retention time data between the sample and the standards of the \\ndifferent isomers. \\n3.  Comparison of IR data obtained via FT IR or GC-IR between the sample and the \\nstandard. \\niii. If a positional isomer still cannot be determined, it is acceptable to use the following remarks lines in conjunction with a genera l identification that does not identify the \\npositional isomer. (The choice depends on wh ether or not the isomers are controlled \\nas well.) 1. Remarks: The positional isomer of  XXX could not be determined.   \\n2. Remarks: The positional isomer of XXX could not be determined, however, all \\nof its positional isomers are controlled in the Illinois Compiled Statutes. a. Example:   Methylethcathinone , a synthetic cathinone.   \\n   \\nRemarks: The positional isomer of  Methylethcathinone could not be \\ndetermined, however, all of its positiona l isomers are controlled in the Illinois \\nCompiled Statutes. \\n 2. Khat \\n \\na. Suspected Khat cases containing fresh plant material should be refrigerated upon arrival \\nat the laboratory and analyzed as soon as possible to minimize the conversion of \\ncathinone to cathine.  \\nb. The following technique is one possible extraction for suspected Khat:  \\n \\nGrind plant material with a 1:1 mixture of cold CHCl3: Saturated Na2CO3.  Sit for \\n10 minutes while remaining cold.  Filter th rough glass wool, remove the chloroform \\nlayer, evaporate with air, and recons titute in a microvi al of methanol. \\n \\n3. Clandestine Laboratories \\n \\ni. Analytical Considerations \\n \\n1.  Evidence submitted from a clandestin e laboratory will be limited to the \\nidentification of controlled substances  and possible precursors. No capacity \\ncalculations, theoretical yiel ds, or determination of routes of synthesis will be \\nperformed.  \\n2.  Clandestine lab samples can be solid, liquid, or a comb ination of the two. Liquids \\nmay be multilayered and may require sampling from each layer. \\n3.  Testing liquids with Wate smo paper and/or pH pape r can provide a good starting \\npoint for analysis. A basic aqueous samp le may only require extracting with a \\nsuitable solvent. A non-aqueous sample can be injected neat bu t may require clean-\\nup steps to remove interfering peaks (i .e. using hydrochlor ic acid fu\\n mes to \\nprecipitate out the suspected methamphetamine and then separating the precipitate from the original solvent). \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

For solids, it is best to avoid sampling a ny Lithium metal that may be present. Be \\naware that performing a Sodium Nitroprussi de color test on a strongly basic item \\ncontaining methamphetamine may result in a false negative red color. \\n \\nii. Safety Considerations \\n \\n1.  Evidence may contain strong acids or bases which can cause injuries if they come \\ninto contact with skin. Because they can also penetrate clothes or lab coats, extra \\ncare should be taken when hand ling clandestine lab evidence. \\n2.  Clandestine labs often contain solvents which emit noxious or harmful vapors. For this reason, these samples should be handl ed in the hood, opened slowly, with the \\nmouth of the container of evidence di rected towards the rear of the hood. \\n  \\niii. Storage Considerations \\n \\n1.  Bottles containing clandestine lab evidence s hould be stored upright in order to \\nprevent leakage. \\n2.  When possible, clandestine lab evidence s hould be stored in a cabinet designed for \\nthis purpose.  \\n \\n4. Opium  i. In order to identify Opiu m, the following five compounds  need to be identified: \\n1.  Morphine \\n2.  Codeine \\n3.  Thebaine \\n4.  Papaverine \\n5.  Noscapine \\nii. Analytical Considerations 1.  Preliminary 1. Color tests: Use Mecke, Marquis or  Froehde’s as a preliminary test. \\n2. GC/FID: Extract the sample and analyze. All five  compounds’ retention times \\nmust be recorded. \\n2.  Confirmatory 1. GC/MS: Extract the sample and id entify the above listed compounds.  \\n2. A primary Opium standard may also be used for comparison after the confirmation of the above compounds. \\niii. It is acceptable to use the following re marks line when identifying Opium. \\n1.  Remarks: The five individual compounds  of Morphine, Codeine, Thebaine, \\nPapaverine and Noscapine have been identified when confir\\nming Opium. \\n   \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

This will by no means be an all- inclusive list, as analysts will need to use their own discretion on a case -\\nby-case basis.  \\n Minimum Standards and Controls are not to be used as a substitute for good scientific procedures. On an individual case, the minimum indicated may not suffice to complete an identification as defined. It is the primary responsibility of the chemist to identify the controlled substance rathe r than \\nsimply fulfill these standards.  \\n \\nADMINISTRATIVE  POLICIES  FOR FOOD PRODUCT  SAMPLING   \\n A. Guidelines  \\n1. Food products that are consistent in appearance in a single container will be seen as one comingled unit and tested as one sample.  This includes, but is not limited to, \\ngummies (not individually wrapped), cereal, chips, cookies, and other candies.  \\n2. Factory sealed containers that are labeled with their contents, in accordance with state guidelines, will not be analyzed unless there is evidence of tampering.  \\n \\n3. A large food product that has been cut, but not separated (i.e., a pan of brownies or bars), will be considered one unit and tested as one item.  \\n \\n4.  Individually wrapped items will be treated as separate items and tested separately . \\n \\n5. Because of the difficulties associated with analyzing food products due to complex matrices, only one sample from one item will initially be analyzed. The analyst will then note whether the remaining samples are consistent in appearance. Analysis on the remaining samples/items will be at the discretion of laboratory management and only completed if requested by the State’s Attorney’s Office.  \\n \\n6. If further analysis is approved to meet statutory requirements, the required number of samples must be tested individually or, if the sample allows, the submission may be analyzed using an approved sampling method. The calculated number of samples determined by the sampling method must each be individually tested to meet the Minimum Standards and Controls for analysis.  \\n \\n \\nMINIMUM STANDARDS AND CONTROLS FOR TESTING TECHNIQUES  \\n \\nMinimum standards and controls for each individual procedure or testing technique can be found in the relevant section of the procedures manual.\\n \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be \\ndisseminated or reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.Accepted Date:    September 13, 2024  \\nDrug Chemistry Procedures Manual DC-App-V \\nPage 1 of 9 \\nVersion 2024.09.13 Appendix V:    Measurement Uncertainty \\n  \\nILLINOIS STATE POLICE \\n \\nDRUG CHEMISTRY \\nPROCEDURES MANUAL \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n APPENDIX V: MEASUREMENT UNCERTAINTY \\nReviewed by: \\n    Forensic Scientist Adrienne  A.

When the most significant \\ncontributing sources are taken into account, a reasonable approxima tion of the true uncertainty \\ncan be given.   The uncertainty of measuremen t is a calculated range of values at a given \\nconfidence interval that allows us to express how  certain we are that the “true” value is within \\nthe stated interval.   \\n The measurement uncertainty associated with ma ss determination is affe cted by factors such \\nas the resolution of the balance, repeatab ility, and linearity. Even  though balances are \\ncalibrated routinely, there is still an amount of  uncertainty associated  with the calibration.  \\nProcess uncertainty considers the reproduci bility of measuremen t over a variety of \\nenvironmental conditions, different locatio ns, different personnel, and replicate \\nmeasurements of similar objects .  The standard weights util ized for function checks are \\ncalibrated at a specified inte rval and carry an amount of calibration uncertainty.  These \\ncomponents are able to be quant ified and used to calculate th e measurement un certainty.  Once \\nthe standard uncertainties are calculated for the above contribu tions, the combined standard \\nuncertainty is calculated and then used to calculate the expanded uncertainty at a confidence level of at least 95.45% .  The expanded uncertainty is calculated for each balance readability \\nand then utilized in the equati on to calculate the total uncertain ty for the mass determination. \\n Each individual measurement has an uncertain ty associated with it.

For example, the \\nMettler Toledo XPR603 balances have a readability of 0.001 g.  \\nAlso known as resolution.  \\nRepeatabilit y: Takin g the same measurement(s) under the same conditions. \\nRoot Sum Square: A statistical  method of dealing with a se ries of values where each \\nvalue is squared, the sum of these squares is calculated and the square root of that sum is then taken. \\nType A uncertainty: This type of uncertainty  is estimated by statistical analysis of a \\nseries of repeated measurements. \\nType B uncertainty: This type of uncertainty is estimated by means other than from \\nobserved measurement. \\nMINIMUM STANDARDS AND CONTROLS \\n1. Calculations for the measurement uncertainty associated with mass determination must be \\nincluded on the worksheet or in the case file for all reported masses greater than or equal \\nto 0.1 gram. Measurement uncertainty does not n eed to be calculated fo r items that are not \\nanalyzed or deferred. \\n \\n2. The total uncertainty must be calculated using the root sum square method. This can be completed using a LIMS worksheet included in the case file or the calculations will be shown in their entirety  with the weight measurement(s)  in the case notes through the \\nmatrix.   a. The weight and uncertainty must  be recorded to the same nu mber of decimal places as \\nthe balance readability, and the uncertainty must always  be rounded up (never down \\nor truncated). \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.   Accepted Date:    September 13, 2024  \\nDrug Chemistry Procedures Manual DC-App-V \\nPage 4 of 9 \\nVersion 2024.09.13 Appendix V:    Measurement Uncertainty \\n i. If more than one balance is used and one of the balanc es has less readability, the \\nrecorded weight and uncertainty will be r ecorded to the readability of the least \\nprecise balance. \\n \\n3. The calculated measurement uncertainty will only  be included on the report in situations \\nwhere it is crucial to the determination of th e weight class or penalty  and could potentially \\nresult in a lower weight class. \\na. The weight and uncertainty must be reported to the same number of decimal places as \\nthe balance readability, and the uncertainty must always  be rounded up (never down \\nor truncated). \\nb. Refer to the “Application of Measuremen t Uncertainty for Mass Determination” \\nsection below for additional reporting guidelines and truncating rules. \\n \\n4. In the case that the uncertainty is deemed crucial to the determination of a weight class, analysis must continue until either enough units have been te sted to negate the importance \\nof the measurement uncertainty, or no additional units remain to be tested. \\n \\n5. In cases with more than two units where an  analyst will be addi ng together individual \\nmass measurements to obtain a total mass, a gross weight will be recorded in the case file. In cases where it is not possible to obtain a gr oss weight (e.g. tablets,  paper squares), a net \\nweight of the total number of units will be obtained. Exceptions to this policy will be noted on the worksheet. \\n \\n6. The measurement uncertainty evaluation budget ta ble for each balance readability will be \\nsaved in LAM. \\n 7. The following events will be assessed against the current budget table: addition of new \\npersonnel, acquisition of new balances, or updated calibration certificates.   \\na. If there is no impact to the expanded uncerta inty calculated with the MU budget table, \\nthis evaluation will be recorded in LAM.   \\nb. If there is a change to the expanded uncerta inty, the evaluation will be recorded in \\nLAM and the updated budget table and MU calculations will be uploaded to LAM. \\n  PROCEDURE OR ANALYSIS \\nEvaluation of Measurement Uncertainty  \\nThe full evaluation of measur ement uncertainty (MU) will be completed by the Command \\nAdvisory Board (CAB) chair or designee as requi red by QM-18. As part of the MU evaluation, \\nthe rounded expanded uncertainty will be cal culated for each balance readability for \\nCommand. \\nIf using the LIMS worksheet, the rounded expanded uncertainty wi ll be populated  for use in \\nthe calculation of the total MU. \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.

If the total mass combined with the uncertainty could result in a change to a lower weight \\nclass, the uncertainty must  be included on the report. \\na. Example 1: 1.005 g of cocaine with an uncer tainty of ± 0.008 g at a 95.45% confidence \\nlevel \\ni. This would give a range of values between 1.013 g and 0.997 g  \\nii. The value could result in a lower weight class, so the uncertainty must be \\nincluded on the report.  \\n \\nb. Example 2: 1.011 g (typically truncated to 1.01 g on report) of heroin with an \\nuncertainty of ± 0.009 g at a 95.45% confidence level \\ni. This would give a range of values between 1.020 g and 1.002 g \\nii. The value would remain above the weight  class, so the uncertainty would not \\nbe included on the report.  \\nc. Example 3: 0.998 g (truncated to 0.9 g on a re port) with an uncertainty of ± 0.004 g at \\na 95.45% confidence level \\ni. This would give a range of values from 1.002 g to 0.994 g \\nii. The uncertainty would not be included on the report because the value is \\ntruncated to 0.9 g which accounts for the uncertainty of the balance in a manner which gives the benefit of th e doubt to the defendant.  \\n \\n \\nREPORT WORDING \\nWhen the measurement uncertainty must be in cluded on the report, a remarks line using the \\nfollowing format should be used: \\nREMARKS:  The uncertainty asso ciated with the mass measuremen t in Item [Z] is [xxx] at a \\n95.45% confidence level. \\n  \\nThe materials contained in this document are protected under federal law and may not be disseminated  \\nor reproduced without the express written permission of the Illinois State Police.
